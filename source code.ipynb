       " b'for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones , it is surprising to find the messenger : the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess . \\nin the early to mid 1400\\'s , there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman . \\nthe church was a dismally dark and oppressive place . \\nfrance was involved in \" the hundred years war \" against england . \\nthere was no strong political leadership in the country . \\nmorale was low , there being little hope for the future . \\nit was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing \" voices \" and seeing \" visions . \" \\nconvinced that these were messages from god , she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him . \\nthe message : if he would give her an army to command , she would deliver to him the crown . \\nhe does . . . \\nand she does . \\nthen , once seated on the throne , he abandons her to her english captors . \\ndirector luc besson ( the fifth element ) may have co-wrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material . \\nthe inconsistencies of the cast , the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes , the inappropriate musical score , and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable . \\nhis biggest miscue was to cast his wife , milla jovovich ( the fifth element ) in the title role . \\nms . jovovich , looks spectacular as joan , clad in battle armor , astride a similarly protected horse . \\nif looks were enough to fully convey a character , she would have been brilliant . \\nsince it isn\\'t , she tried ( and failed ) to act the part . \\nher joan is unbalanced , \" inspiring \" the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed . \\njohn malkovich ( being john malkovich ) fares a bit better as the dauphin , who joan would see on the throne as charles vii . \\nan easily manipulated man , his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death . \\nfaye dunaway ( the thomas crown affair ) gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin\\'s mother-in-law and chief advisor . \\nthe army under joan\\'s command are comprised of comical figures , more stooges than soldiers . \\nthe one exception would be tcheky karyo ( la femme nikita ) as dunois , the man who was leading the attack prior to joan\\'s arrival . \\ntrying to plan a systematic campaign , he sees his leadership authority negated by joan\\'s insistence on following her \" visions . \" \\ndustin hoffman ( sphere ) has a small inhuman role as joan\\'s conscience which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial . \\ndressed like cloaked monk , he leads her to doubt herself and her \" revelations . \" \\nas well she should . \\nscriptures do speak of revelation . \\ngod , via his gift of holy spirit , is able to communicate to men . \\nthree of the nine manifestations of holy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation . \\nthey are : word of knowledge , word of wisdom , and discerning of spirits . \\neven the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his \" holy men . . . \\nwho spake as they were moved by holy spirit ( i . e . \\nby revelation . ) \" \\nbut the scriptures also caution us : \\n \" beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of god : because many false prophets are gone out into the world . \" \\n1 john 4 : 1 [kjv] \\njoan\\'s end , ( being burned at the stake at the age of 19 ) , the frenzy ( mob rule ) and blood lust her inspiration wrought , and the death , pain , or suffering which followed her campaign all point to a devilish influence rather than a godly one . \\nwhile her conviction and intense believing remains an admirable quality , she was , as others have been before and since , misled by the spiritual master of deception . \\nas a messenger , she was quite effective . \\nshe was just confused as to whose message she was carrying . \\n',\n",
       " b'14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds . \\nin 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california . \\nwe laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured . \\ntwo years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them . \\nnow , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die . \\nthey\\'ve been cremated . \\nvegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two . \\nthe premise is basically the same . \\nclark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas . \\nhis wife ellen ( beverly d\\'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick . \\nof course a \" vacation \" movie wouldn\\'t be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times . \\nthere isn\\'t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it . \\nit\\'s really just a skit movie . \\nthere are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know . \\nthe first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit . \\nthe second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes . \\nvegas vacation comes off like the first . \\na good example of the latter would be last year\\'s black sheep . \\nthe problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn\\'t really fit into a movie mold . \\nin these cases , a \" plot \" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i . e . \\nhave a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie ) . \\nsuch is the case with this movie\\'s mini-plots . \\nclark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold\\'s money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d\\'lyn ) as an exotic dancer . \\nthe simple fact is : this movie isn\\'t funny . \\nat first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped . \\nchase plays clark griswold really well . \\nhe made the character and he is the character . \\nd\\'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn\\'t show any signs of redemption . \\nas for the two new griswold kids , the word \" blah \" comes to mind . \\nthe \" vacation \" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them . \\nthey\\'re so generic , you\\'ll expect the credits to read \" girl #1 as audrey griswold \" . \\nvegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor . \\nyes , it\\'s true that vegas vacation isn\\'t even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart . \\nfirst off , why did they leave off the national lampoon\\'s heading on the title ? \\ni couldn\\'t find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn\\'t want to be associated with such a lame film . \\nthat\\'s saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they\\'d be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn\\'t . \\nthere is another difference here that makes an obvious impact . \\nthe first three films in the \" vacation \" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80\\'s including mr . \\nmom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller\\'s day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck . \\nwowzers ! \\nwhat a r ? sum ? ! \\nlooking at the names , you\\'d think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980\\'s . \\nwell that\\'s not all . \\nthis guy also brought us 90\\'s hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber . \\nvegas vacation , however , didn\\'t have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious . \\nthis time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made-for-tv movies . \\nvegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made-for-tv sequel . \\nif this sounds like a wild idea , it\\'s not . \\nrevenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it . \\nvegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m . \\nsunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it\\'s quite out of place . \\nstephen kessler\\'s jejune direction doesn\\'t help things either . \\nhe only makes the film even more tv-movie-ish . \\neach consecutive \" vacation \" movie has suffered a drop in directing power . \\nwe started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co-writing ghostbusters . \\nnot too bad . \\nthen we had national lampoon\\'s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who\\'s talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high . \\nlastly we had national lampoon\\'s christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s . chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon . \\nkessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 . \\ngranted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal . \\nif you loved the \" vacation \" movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still isn\\'t anything here worth seeing . \\nif you loved them , don\\'t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte . \\nif you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ?

       " b'when i first heard of contact , the hype was building it up as a sci-fi blockbuster . \\nnow , with that in mind , coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster\\'s involvement in the project , i thought \" what in the world is foster doing in a sci-fi blockbuster ? ? ? \" . \\nas it turned out , my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy-turvy . \\nrobert zemeckis , back from the euphoria created by his last film , forrest gump , once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong , contact is sci-fi ? but with a definite difference . \\nbased on the late carl sagan novel of the same name , the story delves itself in questions on science and god ; fact and faith . \\nallie ( foster ) is a radio astronomer . \\nshe spends her time listening to the stars , via ultra-huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system . \\nher passion for `long-distance communication\\' is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham-radio system ( a hobbyist radio communication device ) which her late-father bought for her . \\na scene which particularly strengthens the audiences\\' view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late-mother through the ham-radio system in which her father replied \" not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that , now \" . \\nallie\\'s research is based on the seti project ( search for extra terrestrial intelligence ) , in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation . \\nher work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government , which considers it a waste of taxpayer\\'s money and politically unviable , her supervisor ( tom skerritt ) pulls the plug on seti . \\nundaunted , allie managed to gather a loyal group of `believers\\' and eventually found funding from a large private corporation . \\nthe following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day , she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound-wave . \\nthe news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers , cultist , the media and of course , the government . \\nthe situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission . \\nas the world join forces to build this transport , allie is desperate to be the one to go . \\nshe enrols herself among a few hopefuls , to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation . \\nher eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president\\'s spiritual advisor ( mcconaughey ) ; allie , being an atheist , a result of her belief in fact and science , refuses to budge upon questioning . \\nat this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president\\'s spiritual advisor . \\na strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey . \\nfrom the very first meeting scene , it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects , foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith , hope and the power of the unseen . \\nthe meeting of their worlds , added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless . \\nmany people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous , but by actually immersing yourself in it , gives you an entirely different perspective ; one which is free from bias and pre-conceptions . \\nzemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film . \\ncontact works by not delving in controversy but rather , touches the thinking audience , urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith ; whether one can actually find compromise within . \\ni consider contact as one of the must-sees for this year . \\n',\n",

disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk . \\n ( there\\'s a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of

much ( \" don\\'t worry , you\\'ll be back on your knees in no time \" ) but when he is bullied into taking care of simon\\'s dog , his life is turned topsy-turvey . \\nmelvin is sequestered because

to work so she can serve him , he pays for a specialist to treat her son . \\nhe even develops a friendship with simon . \\nall three people are heavily damaged . \\nmelvin has retreated from life in

       " b\"capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything . \\na time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with . \\nit is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why . \\nright from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible . \\na pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead . \\nafter their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial . \\nmcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics . \\nthe acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have . \\nsandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box . \\nthe most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part . \\ni always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact . \\nthere is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this . \\nbecause the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting . \\none of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic . \\ni was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter . \\nthe movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes . \\nfirst of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma . \\nhe's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade . \\nthe old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story . \\nit just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics . \\nanother mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character . \\ni'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible . \\n ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . ) \\nis jackson's character then simply insane ? \\nthat prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either . \\none of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information . \\nmcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense . \\nhow did the prosecution get this information ? \\nhow come he didn't get it ? \\nthe whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion . \\nthis is the biggest problem : the movie isn't about jackson's character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters . \\nit's not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared-down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending . \\nat two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there's endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter . \\nit's all handwaving . \\nthe closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair . \\nit's not easy to make a movie about something . \\nthe other day i saw kurosawa's phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don't ) . \\na time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time . \\n\",\n",
       " b'well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task . \\nhe has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films . \\nin a domain that he owns , it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script from a bad one . \\neraser , back in 1996 , was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense . \\nbatman and robin , in 1997 , was the black sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting , idiotic action scenes , and painfully flashy costumes . \\nnow in 1999 , \" end of days \" ( not \" the end of days \" ) is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold . \\nis this the end of a powerful action star\\'s long-lived career ? \\nwill arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past ( \" terminator \" , \" terminator 2 : judgement day \" , \" predator \" ) ? \\nor an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in the past ( \" commando \" , \" red sonja \" , \" true lies \" ) ? \\nit doesn\\'t look that way . \\n \" end of days \" begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably , due to the formation of the stars on that night , will be the carrier of satan\\'s baby the hour before new year\\'s of 2000 . \\nfortunately for the movie\\'s sake , the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers , subway trains in dark tunnels , and a myriad of inept nypd officers . \\nit\\'s an action film\\'s dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up . \\nimagine if the girl had lived in anytown , usa , where the only thing to destroy is a dairy queen and a post office . \\narnold schwarzenegger ( jericho cane ) , in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church , who is trying to hide the girl ( or in some cases trying to kill her ) , and satan ( gabriel byrne ) who is trying to make her pregnant . \\nif the devil is successful , the world will no longer exist as we know it . \\njericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1 ) he once had faith but no longer does and 2 ) his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it . \\njericho cane is your cliched , by-the-numbers hero right up to his name . \\narnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can . \\nhe shouts at everyone , from cops to priests , to the devil . \\nin one truly hilarious scene , which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point , jericho screams to the devil ; \" you are a @#$^% ! & \\nchoir boy ! \\nyou are a choir boy ! \" \\nthose two lines marked the high points of this film . \\na movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor . \\n \" end of days \" fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne . \\nbyrne , playing a man who has been made the manifestation of the devil , seems to be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie . \\nhe wonderfully plays a manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time . \\nthe annoying thing about his character , however , is that he has the power to kill any human with a simple punch in the face , yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho . \\ni can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody . \\nthe other actors in the film give very weak and unconvincing performances . \\nkevin pollak , who plays the partner and close friend of jericho , is the supposedly funny character in the film ( every action movie has one ) . \\nthe one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line . \\nrobin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan\\'s baby with extreme annoyance . \\nshe gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the film , except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter , or any of the viewers in the audience . \\nin one unnecessary scene , tunney walks out of her room and takes her top off . \\nis this her job in the film ? \\nthe actors are not to blame entirely because the script is terrible . \\nyou can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen minutes before it does . \\nthis little prediction game is a very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of a movie . \\nin a last attempt to make this movie good , special effects are used to try to entertain the audience . \\nbut without a memorable action scene in the whole film , the director has not done his job successfully . \\nthis film would have gotten a c+ if arnold stood in front of a camera and shouted \" you are a ! $@^@ * ^ \\nchoir boy ! ! \" \\nfor two hours . \\n',\n",

       " b'talk about beating a dead horse ! \\nwhen home alone was released in 1990 , it was a breath of fresh air , and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film . \\nthe unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited . \\nfor john hughes , two home alone movies weren\\'t enough ? he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including a pathetic box office bomb called baby\\'s day out , last year\\'s live-action 101 dalmatians , and this year\\'s flubber . \\nnow , inexplicably , hughes has exhumed not only these worn-out plot elements , but the \" home alone \" name as well . \\nthe result ? 1997\\'s worst sequel ( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin ) , home alone 3 . \\nby changing the characters , hughes ( who wrote and co-produced the film ) , along with his co-conspirator , director raja gosnell , has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest . \\nthe new kid , alex pruitt , is played by alex d . linz ( one fine day ) , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness . \\nhe\\'s not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was . \\nthe villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber . \\nin home alone 3 , there are four of them ( olek krupa , david thornton , lenny von dohlen , and rya kihlstedt ) , but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls . \\nthis time , the kid isn\\'t left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip . \\ninstead , he has developed a bad case of chicken pox , so he can\\'t go to school . \\nhis dad ( kevin kilner ) is away on business and his mom ( haviland morris ) has to run errands , so , for the most part , he\\'s all by himself during the day . \\nthrough a series of coincidences too irritating to relate , a top secret u . s . air force integrated circuit comes into his possession . \\nit\\'s wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex\\'s home to retrieve it . \\nthe eight- year old , who is wise beyond his years , booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg-type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains . \\nthe movie\\'s climax takes place during a raging snowstorm ? only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable . \\npreviously , the most counterfeit-looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii . \\nthese are far worse . \\nin fact , the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near-blizzard when a shining sun can be seen . \\nif it\\'s a wonderful life could generate real- looking snow back in the 1940s , why can\\'t home alone 3 , which has a significantly larger budget and \\'90s technology at its disposal ? \\nthere has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live-action cartoon violence for young children . \\nhome alone 3 will add fuel to the fire . \\nit\\'s one thing to see wyle e . coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight , but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen . \\nadults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous , but what about five and six-year olds ? \\nthe level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme ? many of alex\\'s schemes are nasty enough to kill . \\nbut , because this is a \" family film , \" no one dies , despite being electrocuted , falling thirty feet , and getting smacked on the head by a barbell . \\nnot only is home alone 3 unnecessary , but it\\'s offensive . \\nit\\'s an exercise in tediousness , and there isn\\'t a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end ( unless , by some strange quirk of fate , you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes , and thus haven\\'t seen this stuff before ) . \\ni can\\'t imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure . \\nmaybe that\\'s why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb-sucking years . \\n',\n",
       " b'the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits . \\nthe rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that\\'s exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is . \\nlast year\\'s speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year\\'s species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory . \\nin some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer . \\nwhatever uniqueness the original might\\'ve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller . \\njulie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion . \\njulie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) . \\nwill and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics . \\nunfortunately , things aren\\'t so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook . \\nit\\'s another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending . \\nthere\\'s not much that\\'s original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it\\'s unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel . \\nfor die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer . \\nthe aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn\\'t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing . \\nthe man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments . \\nmuch of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point . \\nthe whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem . \\nand , whereas the killer\\'s identity might\\'ve been a question in the first movie , it\\'s almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically . \\nthree or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as \" the killer . \" \\nthey\\'re almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show . \\nand so , in the end , it\\'s left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast . \\ngod help us . \\n',\n",

       " b'because the press screening of \" planet of the apes \" was one day past last issue\\'s deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece . \\nthe chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg\\'s character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked . \\nto those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ? \\nthis is a tim burton movie , boys and girls . \\ntim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories . \\nfor the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated \" mars attacks ! \" \\n ( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage \" mars attacks ! \" \\ntrading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up . \\nburton\\'s re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great . \\nthe apes , courtesy of make-up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold . \\nlike astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later . \\nas for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character . \\nfrom his start as a filmmaker , burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits ( pee-wee herman , the joker , ed wood , the ack-acking martians , etc . ) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes . \\nso leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders . \\nas for lack of color , remember , leo only launches into space to get his monkey back . \\nhe doesn\\'t want to lead humanity and he isn\\'t looking for romance from a pretty , but dull human ( estella warren ) or a dynamic ape ( helena bonham carter , terrific as an equal-rights activist ) . \\nas a man who just wants out , wahlberg is focused , subtle and sly . \\nthe surprise ending provides the requisite shock ( and some more dandy visuals , particularly of the approaching authority figures ) , but admittedly isn\\'t nearly as satisfying as the one in the original . \\nfor the original ending to work , we only had to make one simple connection , for this one , we have to write a whole new screenplay . \\nthe 1968 \" apes \" boasted a handful of great scenes , cool looking monkeys , a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston ( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed , re-delivering a classic line ) and a killer ending . \\nbut viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball . \\nthe 2001 \" planet of the apes \" offers a different set of great scenes , much cooler looking monkeys , fine acting from wahlberg , bonham carter , paul giamatti and tim roth , and a not so good ending . \\nit also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that\\'s nothing to complain about . \\n',\n",

\\na pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a \" wacky \" demise . \\nthere is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye\\'s , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) . \\nfinally , just one word : monsters . \\nfaye dunaway and peter o\\'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o\\'toole overacts he\\'s entertaining and when dunaway does it she\\'s annoying ( her character actually says the line \" seize them ! \" \\nat one point ) . \\ndunaway\\'s henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty\\'s otis character from the first two superman movies . \\nhelen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she\\'s written to be , as she\\'s able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . \\nbelievability aside though , it\\'s still annoying . \\nnow despite all this negativity ( and i\\'m not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! \\nthey have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . . \\nyet i\\'m still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) . \\nthe first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters . \\nthe movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory . \\nextras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and \" special project consultant \" scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries . \\nthe transfer on this international version is incredible . . . \\nyou\\'d think you were watching a new release . \\nimages are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . \\nonly some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn\\'t much that can be done about that ( unless you\\'re obsessive like george lucas ) . \\nthe new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you\\'ll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams\\' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films\\' golan-globus production ) . \\nthe commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . \\nbosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there\\'s no dead air on the track . \\nbosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . \\nalthough , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn\\'t get that response . \\nwe learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the \" almost \" appearance in the film by christopher reeve . \\ngreat detail is given about superman\\'s proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . \\nas it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . \\nfor the sake of brevity , i won\\'t even get into that one . \\nszwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy \" whimsical fantasy \" nonsense . \\nbosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . \\nagain , for the sake of brevity , i won\\'t even get into that one . \\nanchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . \\ndisc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . \\ndisc two features the never before seen director\\'s cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long . \\nthe additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don\\'t add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o\\'toole\\'s screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . \\nthe print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won\\'t care . \\none question though . . . \\nshouldn\\'t the director\\'s commentary be on the director\\'s cut of the film ? \\ni\\'d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . \\ni was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . \\nso when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . \\ni knew the film wasn\\'t beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . \\nas the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . \\ncome to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . \\nso i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . \\nat the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . \\nugh , i give up . \\ni\\'m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . \\nsupergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie . \\n[pg] \\n',\n",
       " b'the u . s . army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done . \\none particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting . \\nunder the \" saluting \" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer . \\nthe salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail . \\nin any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group . \\nalmost at the very beginning of the general\\'s daughter , we see a general\\'s motorcade passing a work detail . \\neveryone salutes . \\nit looked impressive , but it just wasn\\'t right . \\nthat little bit showed me that someone either didn\\'t do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene . \\nin fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie . \\nwhat results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn\\'t right . \\nthe first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example . \\npaul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army\\'s criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale . \\nprior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn\\'t the unscrupulous supply sergeant he\\'s supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living . \\nso ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we\\'ll just say that it involves propellers ) . \\nbrenner then receives new orders when the commanding general\\'s daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base\\'s training ranges . \\nhe is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder . \\nwhat i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary . \\nit gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he\\'s a little cocky . \\ndoes the arms subplot turn up later ? \\nno , so why add this extra running time to the film ? \\nthe answer : it looked cool . \\nor how about the \" atmosphere \" ? \\nthe beginning of the general\\'s daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music . \\nnice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn\\'t matter , for when the film\\'s plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood . \\nno attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme . \\ndid the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? \\ninstead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside . \\nthe above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie . \\nas i\\'ve already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn\\'t jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty . \\nbrenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest \" yes , sir \" s i\\'ve ever heard . \\nhe even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general\\'s daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous . \\nsunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity . \\nboth characters are protagonists , but it\\'s hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing . \\ni could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , \" let\\'s do it again , but this time , i want more . \" \\ni say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes . \\nan even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general\\'s aide , colonel fowler . \\ni swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention . \\na far cry from his days as linc in \" the mod squad \" , i can\\'t help but think he was acting from west\\'s direction . \\na couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear . \\nthe only two actors who seem to have escaped west\\'s influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth\\'s mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police . \\nwoods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people\\'s minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top . \\nhutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn\\'t overacting . \\ni haven\\'t read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i\\'ll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form . \\nthe movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished . \\nevery time we\\'re presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it\\'s the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all . \\ninstead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead . \\nthe army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was . \\nwould\\'ve been over in a half hour . \\nthe film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning . \\nliterally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off . \\nthey both seem kind of happy . \\nmaybe they were driving away from simon west . \\n',\n",

ki often matches the colour of characters\\' clothes with the background colour and/or lighting , so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment . \\nthere is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ; ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire ; their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love . \\ntheir downward , downsized , downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic , as one setback succeeds another , bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel . \\nit must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs , more farce , more deadpan wit , but the film\\'s great strength is the sober , empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona\\'s misfortunes . \\nirony would be an injustice . \\nsituations and settings are broad and exaggerated--this is not realism--but they are not distorted . \\nthe emotions are authentic . \\nif it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens , despite the droll performances , the laconic humour , that\\'s because kaurism ? ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered . \\nhe shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty-eight , who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position , to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two-bit restaurant ; how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 to confront his wife\\'s former employer , demanding the rest of her wages , only to have the crap beaten out of him , unable to land a single punch , when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money . \\nall this is observed keenly , with great economy : every cut , every line of dialogue , is judicious . \\nif most films are novelistic in their telling , this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story to bear . \\nbut what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96-minute running length . \\ni have seen many movies far less profound , less humane , less necessary than drifting clouds , but they filled me with an urge to watch them again , and this one did not . \\nit does not need to be seen twice : its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing . \\nit is not a movie that will be seen by a large audience , because it cannot be pitched to one . \\nthere is no selling point . \\nit is all understatement , restraint , melancholy . \\nthe characters are unremarkable , their best years behind them , their dreams dissipated ; it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills . \\nthis does not make them less fascinating , merely less marketable , which is a shame , because this is a movie which should be seen , precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore . \\nit engages us and touches us and resolves--surprisingly , and movingly--into something resembling a happy ending . \\nthe only thing greater than the ill-luck that governs the characters\\' lives is their refusal to give in to despair . \\ntheir persistence is rewarded with what might be called a \" feel-good \" ending elsewhere , but not here , because this ending differs in kind from most such endings : this one has truly been earned . \\n',\n",
       " b'when i left the theater after seeing david lynch\\'s \" lost highway , \" i remarked to a fellow movie-goer , \" i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears . \" \\nin his first feature film in five years , lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture \" eraserhead \" on the weirdness scale . \\nyou won\\'t \" know \" what happened when it\\'s over , though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses . \\nit is difficult to describe the plot of this film , because it depends partly on how you interpret it . \\ni can , however , describe what we see on the screen : l . a . jazz saxophonist fred madison ( bill pullman ) and his wife renee ( patricia arquette ) , whom he clearly suspects of infidelity , receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep . \\nthey are , naturally enough , more than a little frightened and confused , and it doesn\\'t help matters any when \" mystery man \" ( robert blake ) approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons\\' house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving . \\nthe next morning , fred finds another videotape which , to his ( and our ) surprise , shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom . \\nhe is convicted of her murder and sent to death row , where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton ( balthazar getty ) . \\nthe perplexed prison officials release dayton , whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways - most notably his affair with alice wakefield ( arquette again ) , a blonde who is otherwise renee\\'s spitting image , and another encounter with the mystery man . \\ni would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more , but suffice it to say that lynch doesn\\'t offer any neat wrap ? ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of \" lost highway \" are out in full force from beginning to end . \\nthis description might make \" lost highway \" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch\\'s weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time . \\non the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch\\'s previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther . \\nthe film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery . \\nthere are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings-on here . \\nwe , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred\\'s , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent . \\nall of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch\\'s typically slow-paced , idiosyncratic style . \\nas is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in \" lost highway \" it works perfectly . \\nthere are scenes when the camera lingers on fred\\'s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil\\'s \" song to the siren \" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically \" happening \" in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity . \\nlynch\\'s direction and director of photography pete deming\\'s darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story . \\nwell , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer\\'s attention because of its tie-ins to the original mystery . \\nthe main characters in this \" reality \" - dayton ( a well-meaning but none too intelligent 24-year-old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn-star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you couldn\\'t find in any of the two dozen \" pulp fiction \" wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film\\'s spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch . \\nlynch\\'s typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here . \\nit\\'s not exactly exploitative - like almost everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off . \\nthat said , these minor flaws don\\'t prevent \" lost highway \" from attaining its place as one of the darkest , most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years . \\nit is a one-way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind , and as such it is gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective . \\n',\n",

       " b'call it touched by a demon . \\ngregory hoblit\\'s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . \\nif marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . \\nin fact , there\\'s even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion\\'s share of the weirdness distilled out . \\n ( remember bob ? ) \\nthe biggest failing of fallen is that , although it\\'s consistently interesting , it\\'s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . \\na serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . \\nnow , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , \" what goes around really goes around . \" \\nshortly thereafter , he begins to sing \" time is on my side \" as he\\'s taken on his last walk . \\nminutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . \\nbut for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn\\'t a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . \\nand , with reese\\'s death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . \\nonly hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they\\'re up against . \\nthe rest of the cops , including hobbes\\' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don\\'t have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . \\nas depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . \\nno skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . \\nthe most famous landmark to appear isn\\'t the liberty bell or independence hall ; it\\'s geno\\'s steaks . \\nshadows and night scenes abound . \\nthe days are cloudy and unpromising . \\nthis is the kind of setting where it\\'s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . \\nfallen\\'s plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . \\nsomehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . \\nbut the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . \\nnevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . \\nthe film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . \\nof the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . \\njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . \\nsadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . \\neveryone else , including denzel washington , is boring . \\nwashington\\'s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . \\nit\\'s not that he\\'s bad per se , but he\\'s not very interesting . \\nthere\\'s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . \\nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . \\nwashington\\'s subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . \\nhowever , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler\\'s list ) and donald sutherland . \\nto be fair , the flaws in their characters aren\\'t all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . \\nthat said , however , there\\'s nothing inspired about either davidtz\\'s or sutherland\\'s work . \\nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . \\nnarratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . \\nalthough the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . \\nat times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like \" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself \" become a little hard to swallow . \\nin addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . \\nhowever , despite the negatives , i\\'m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . \\nthe final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . \\nit\\'s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . \\nat a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . \\nthis is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it\\'s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . \\nand , whatever you do , don\\'t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll . \\n',\n",

\\nit\\'s written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i\\'ve ever heard . \\nif it is , i can\\'t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \\na plotless , pointless rock n\\' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \\nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . \\nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \\nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" \\nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don\\'t provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \\nit\\'s as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ? \\nfunny ! \" \\nlook , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\nlook , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . \\ntwice . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\nlook , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\na word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren\\'t funny all by themselves . \\nthey must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn \\'t predicted them five minutes in advance . \\nthat\\'s it , i\\'ve said enough about this movie . \\nit\\'s a waste of time and money . \\ni liked the music , but don\\'t bother buying the soundtrack . \\ni hear it\\' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . \\nyou want to see this concept executed well ? \\ngo rent roger corman\\'s 1979 classic \" rock n\\' roll high school . \" \\nit features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show . \\nyes , go rent that , and skip \" detroit rock city , \" which will probably bomb , and deservedly so . \\n',\n",
       " b'plot : a peculiar french girl grows up lonely with her father and doesn\\'t quite know what she wants out of life . \\none day , she falls upon something , and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others . \\nshe starts with the people around her , but when she suddenly falls for her own guy , she can\\'t act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature . \\ncritique : a clever , quirky , original french flick set in a picturesque paris , featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination , much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone . \\nthis is a \" feel-good \" kind of movie , a fairy tale for grown-ups who are bummed out about life . \\nit doesn\\'t pretend to be deep , it doesn\\'t weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters , it\\'s basically just a \" cute movie \" in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward , with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions ( and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year ( a sham on so many different levels ) , you might as well slap this film up for consideration also , since it\\'s quite a bit better and much more original than the former ) . \\none thing that this film isn\\'t though , at least according to me , is the best film of the year ( it was bestowed the honor of \" best \" in at least 3 different film festivals so far this year ) . \\nit actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long ( it\\'s a little over two hours but it felt even longer ) , with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters , all of whom weren\\'t as interesting as the lead , and a lot of indecisiveness from ms . amelie herself , which got frustrating . \\nthankfully , this film doesn\\'t bog itself down with too much of that stuff , and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes , to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kind-hearted french girl . \\non the whole , it\\'s a lot of fun and it carries a beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man . \\nthe lead , audrey tautou , is perfect for the role , and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film . \\nunfortunately , the rest of the cast isn\\'t as well-developed , and even though most of them are pretty appealing , a couple could\\'ve been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plot-wise , by the film\\'s end ( what happened to the guy in the caf ? who was spying on his ex-girlfriend the whole movie ? ) . \\nnow i haven\\'t seen too many recent french films , i will admit , but if this is the kind of \" scene \" that they\\'re developing over in \" le pays du vin \" , i wouldn\\'t mind catching more of their flicks in the future ( crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year , which i really liked- ironically , that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz , who is the co-star in this film ) . \\ngranted , the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times ( i speak and understand french also , but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head ) , especially since the film\\'s visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn\\'t help but constantly gawk at them , but the general idea , the background music , the nifty french neighborhoods , the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the story-line from the start , were all very easy to appreciate , and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world . \\nin fact , i\\'d recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol\\' time at the movie house , with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot of imagination , a little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts . \\nand this guy directed alien : resurrection ? \\nget outta here ! ! \\nnote : i especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the loves/hates of everyone with exact mentions in the film . \\nit was very original , very well shot and very nostalgic , as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described . \\ngood stuff ! \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\nchocolat ( 6/10 ) - crimson rivers ( 8/10 ) - ghost world ( 9/10 ) - like water for chocolate ( 8/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - pay it forward ( 5/10 ) - rushmore ( 9/10 ) - woman on top ( 7/10 ) \\n',\n",
       " b'okay , bear with me y\\'all , cause first off i have to get this off my chest : \\nwhat the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ? \\nwhew . okay . \\ncause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end , as cute as the crab maybe . \\neven i know that you need more footage than * that * . \\nand that wasn\\'t the only thing getting on my nerves . \\nthe cutesy gimmicks , saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flannery ( as tom ) might have held some appeal during , oh , say the first 10 minutes of the movie . \\nat first the movie moves along at a quick , interesting pace . \\nit is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street , whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesn\\'t * die . \\na ridiculous concept , yes , but at this point i\\'m willing to accept it because i\\'m willing to accept that this is how amanda\\'s life is changed , how her powers are received . \\nlater on , the movie can\\'t seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom . \\nand this is why the clips of the crab were annoying ; they weren\\'t just repetitive , they were out of place and unnecessary . \\nthe plot stumbles along at an uneven speed , sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development ( amanda suddenly becoming a great chef , her falling in love with tom , etc . ) , sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good . \\nsome places the plot just doesn\\'t make sense , sometimes it\\'s way too contrived ( the crab bit , for example ) , and sometimes too corny ( peaches emitting dry ice . \\ncan\\'t beat that ) . \\nall in all the plot seemed fragmented , unconnected . \\nnot romantic at all , and only funny in some places . \\nso , okay , do the magic powers come from the crab ? \\nor the fairy godfather ? \\nshe can * float * now too ? \\nand all of a sudden , instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches , she can put her emotions into her food ? \\ntom all of a sudden just accepts amanda\\'s \" witchcraft \" in the end ? \\nwould people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac\\'s video ? \\nwhat the hell is up with that damn crab ? \\nit is unfortunate , because i liked the basic premise of the movie , until it became too fantastical and tiresome . \\nthe film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while , but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables . \\nthe humor was good in some places ( nolan gets the funniest bits , including that incomprehensible , totally random thing with the dolls ) . \\ngellar and flannery are qualified actors , and gellar has a particular charm , but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy ( or even annette in the upcoming \" cruel intentions \" ) than this sorry excuse for a character . \\nit\\'s almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is , or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible . \\nthe supporting character nolan was a highlight , though he reminded me a bit of kevin in \" you\\'ve got mail \" ( see footnotes ) . \\nand , as always , typical of a chick flick / romantic comedy , there\\'s a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background , cued up at all the right places . \\nthis sort of got on the nerves after a while , too . \\n \" simply irresistible \" is not hard to understand , light , funny in some places , and generally disappointing because it can\\'t draw the line between romance and protracted sap , between humor and tired slapstick . \\nand how could i refrain from making a pun ? \\n . \\n . \\n . \\n \" simply irresistible \" is all too easy to resist . \\n ( first viewing , 2/6/99 ) \\n * did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to \" you\\'ve got mail \" ( or \" the shop around the corner \" ) ? \\nbusiness rivals fall in love . \\nfemale counterpart\\'s business is in danger of being shut down . \\nfemale as mother- like figure guiding her . \\nthe annoying , hysterical ex-girlfriends . \\n * i _really_ like sarah michelle gellar\\'s wardrobe . \\n',\n",
       " b\"expectation rating : a bit worse than expected ( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull ) . \\nroger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film . \\ni read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it . \\nthe opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter . \\nthe landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) ) . \\none can almost sense the cold . \\nbut the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better . \\nthis is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots . \\nthe movie also reminded me of affliction , as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father , and they see a chance for such a dream to come true . \\nthis chance is uncovered in a snow covered field , where an airplane has crash landed . \\nin the plane three men find ? the american dream . . . \\nin a gym bag . ? \\naffliction too was set in a snowy landscape . \\nit really seems very simple . \\njust hold on to the money until spring , and if no one claims it , they'll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true . \\nbut the snow melts , and so might several of the character's hopes . \\nas in ? return to paradise ? , some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing . \\nbut doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish . \\nthe movie's biggest strength is that it fact makes sense . \\ni have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized , eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story -- for example clear and present danger . \\nthe biggest problem seems to over-familiarization with the story . \\nthe writer perhaps feels that he doesn't have to present scenes that are clear to him , but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book . \\nthis is definitely not the problem with a simple plan , even though the screenplay is by the book's author . \\nthe movie is always clear on where it's going , and always makes sense . \\ni'm sue a lot was cut , but really i can't remember what . \\neven a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included . \\nthe man only comes in on mondays , but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many . \\nturns out . . . \\nwell , see the movie . \\none should be warned against seeing the trailer . \\nit reveals several scenes from the ending moments ( which yes , like in the book , it is a downer ) , several plot developments , and much of the beginning . \\nbut much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer , so if you're lucky , you'll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie . \\n\",\n",

       " b'after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy , i was ready for some mindless fun--oh , maybe something like tango & cash . \\nmaybe not ! \\nmindless fun is one thing , but brain-dead slop is another matter altogether . \\ntango & cash has \" lowest common denominator \" written all over it . \\nthe movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l . a . russell plays cash , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts . \\nstallone plays tango , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it ; he doesn\\'t need the money . \\nin an effort to change his image , stallone goes for a yuppie , gq look in the film , wearing spectacles and three piece suits . \\nthe two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names . \\ntango & cash is unbearably noisy . \\nfor starters , there\\'s harold faltermeyer\\'s annoying synthesized score , which gets old after four notes . \\nto make matters worse , the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars , the more the merrier . \\nin fact , the movie begins with not one but two car chases . \\nthere\\'s nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie . \\nscreenwriter randy feldman\\'s brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv . \\nhis shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it , such as stallone\\'s efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual . \\nin a movie with the iq level of an amoeba , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent--and stallone is no lawrence olivier . \\nit\\'s hard to imagine anyone reading feldman\\'s script and thinking , \" i want to be in this movie . \" \\nthe film\\'s plot doesn\\'t have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting . \\nfeldman\\'s story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable . \\nthey simply could have called it \" action movie . \" \\nevery character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies . \\nadding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a \" road runner \" cartoon . \\naction movies don\\'t have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you\\'re not thinking about the lack of realism . \\nthe only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography . \\nthere are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires . \\nthe film\\'s main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell . \\nunfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants . \\nthe dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing . \\nit\\'s a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming \" lethal weaponesque \" adventure . \\ntango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes . \\nseeing russell in drag is the movie\\'s funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials . \\nfurthermore , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence . \\nmachine guns and torture generally don\\'t mix well with comedy . \\njack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best : playing a sleazy , conniving villain . \\nhis character , however , is run-of-the-mill , except for his strange obsession with mice . \\nlike many movie villains , palance likes to play games . \\nin fact , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room . \\nyou have to wonder why palance doesn\\'t just shoot the detectives in the head ! \\nthe story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent . \\nteri hatcher plays stallone\\'s sister and russell\\'s love-interest , and she is just as pretty as can be . \\nbut regrettably , hatcher\\'s acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty . \\nevery time she opens her mouth , you cringe ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination . \\nthere\\'s really very little , if anything , to recommend in the film . \\nand , more to the point , tango definitely isn\\'t worth a penny of your cash--so don\\'t bother . \\n',\n",
       " b\"seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) . \\none of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . \\nwith some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . \\nthere's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . \\nthe goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . \\nthe premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist . \\nwe begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely . \\nlater he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right . \\nthe fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . \\nthis opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . \\nthe man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . \\nin fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while . \\nbut in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . \\neventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . \\nwe met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . \\ntwo other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies . \\nit was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . \\nhe also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . \\nbut absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . \\neverything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities . \\nhowever , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . \\nby continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax . \\neveryone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . \\nbut , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . ' \\nfor reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) . \\nthe aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . \\nat the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . \\nthis premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . \\nhe does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . \\nthe aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not . \\nin the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . \\nhowever , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . \\nthe main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) . \\nfor example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending . \\nand that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . \\nironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . \\nwith `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . \\nstill , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . \\nthere's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . \\nthe story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . \\n`dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world . \\n\",\n",
       " b'at first glance , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise . \\nits plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell , desiring to take over the world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power . \\nhe attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon\\'s parents . \\ngiven a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying father , talon vows for revenge . \\neleven years later , when he\\'s established his own army , the mercaneries , he vows to take back his kingdom . \\nalong the way , he meets up with alana , whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell . \\ntalon vows to help , and , after a series of minor escapades , eventually ends up rescuing alana\\'s brother ( and several other prisoners ) , only to be captured himself ( in other words , put on a cross to be crucified ! ) . \\nfortunately he frees himself , rescues alana from marrying cromwell , defeats xusia , and then cromwell , all with his triple bladed sword ( during the final battle , the blade breaks , but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade ) . \\nthen , everything ends happily . \\nunfortunately , the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds . \\nwhat would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping , bad acting , and gruesomely gory , bloody scenes . \\nnever once does the story seem to connect together , it just jumps around repeatedly . \\nthis problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia . \\nafter telling him that he needs his help , he leads the warlock out into daylight , but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards . \\nwait a minute , didn\\'t the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh-dan , which he cannot do by military force ? \\nif that is the case , why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him ? \\nand why does he manage to take over eh-dan anyway ? \\nthese questions are just never - no , never - answered in the film . \\nanother example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life , another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana\\'s wedding to cromwell ( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with alana , he just tells her to \" wait \" , and then he just rides off ! \\nin addition to the extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure . \\neven some attempts to make it exciting , a few fire scenes , battle scenes , don\\'t work . \\nit just completely fails altogether miserably . \\nthe only good thing about this film is its musical score , contributed by david whittaker , who had an ( extremely ) short music composing career . \\nthe score is boomy and adventurous , powerful , and a billion times better than this film is . \\nmy suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) . \\nironically , though , before the film\\'s credits roll , there is a message indicating that a sequel , tales of the ancient empire , would follow . \\nto my relief ( and delight ) , it never got into production , because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office , grossing only $39 million . \\ncritics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer , all right . \\nleonard maltin rightfully called it \" second rate in scripting , and acting \" and at-a-glance film reviews called it \" a confusing , stupid , unimaginative , unengaging , bloodfilled bore \" . \\ni totally agree with these reviews , all right , and i hope that this piece of #$% ! \\nwill be forgotten about . \\nthere are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer . \\ni hope you get a good laugh out of this review , but i am not laughing . \\nin fact , my insults don\\'t even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time . \\n',\n",

       " b'm : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value . \\nit tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it\\'s an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses . \\nit is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human . \\nthe coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols . \\nthe film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence . \\nexcept for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . \\nas for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . \\nm : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . \\nthe film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . \\nthe only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film\\'s supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . \\nit\\'s a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series . \\nbut its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . \\njohn woo ( \" broken arrow \" / \" face/off \" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can\\'t seem to handle dialogue and suspense . \\nthe star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . \\ncruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one . \\ntheir romance didn\\'t work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn\\'t convincing . \\nthe film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . \\nwe will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville . \\nfirst , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it . \\nhe also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . \\nwhich explains the film\\'s mythic theme . . . as \\nwe enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil . \\nthe one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . \\nat least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . \\nsoon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains . \\nbefore they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone . \\nhe steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust . \\nsean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices . \\nwe already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . \\nwoo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . \\nit makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . \\nnext we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses . \\nhunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team . \\nhe is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped . \\nhopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds . \\nactually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point . \\nin seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road . \\nhe also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her . \\nthe imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh ) . \\nrobert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first \" mission , \" who is noted for doing \" chinatown \" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . \\nthe terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock . \\nethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first . \\nethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean\\'s getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle . \\nethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick\\'s everyone\\'s ass . \\nif i was only entertained by this . . . i \\ncould have lived with it . \\nbut this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam-dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast . \\nin any case , this is a critic-proof film , and will in all probability do well in the box office , as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial

       " b\"8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery . \\nnicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs . christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe . \\nthe movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie' , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed . \\nall mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not . \\nwelles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide . \\nalthough the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most . \\nthe snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away . \\n8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you haven't seen from another standard thriller . \\nthe cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage . \\nwhile he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998 . ) \\nhere , in 8mm , he's boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice . \\nand in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up . \\nonly when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent . \\nhis performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he's just purely enjoyable to watch . \\ncatherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves . \\nher character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year . \\nalso fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director . \\nas this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch . \\nunlike seven , 8mm isn't too clever , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives . \\nlacking the strong characters seven featured , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment . \\nbut director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it's just not very disturbing . \\nschumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience , and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly' of the porn industry , it doesn't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point . \\nalso , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed , so cliched , it's amazing to think it's the same film you're watching . \\n8mm is far from an success , a 'snuffed' opportunity . \\nwith a boring lead character , 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller . \\nultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like . \\nand trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it . \\n\",\n",

however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . \\nstephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . \\nhe is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing . \\neven the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches . \\nin the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man . \\ncamille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes . \\nmaxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife . \\nlike stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges . \\nwhen stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals . \\nhowever , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him . \\nstephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present . \\nas the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another . \\nthese two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently . \\nstephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship . \\nhowever , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation . \\nthe audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher . \\nhowever , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing . \\nconsequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays . \\nin contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier . \\nhowever , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world\\'s finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing . \\nduring the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions . \\nstephane attempts to remain unchanged . \\nhowever , we do see subtle hints of his transformation . \\none of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash . \\nthe development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible . \\namerican movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . \\nin its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane . \\nthe portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille\\'s and stepahne\\'s characters . \\ni am not sure why berardinelli says , \" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil\\'s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . \" \\nthis movie is not about judging stephane\\'s actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are . \\ni find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . \\nthis portion of the film is where the \" sense of closure \" could have been successfully accomplished . \\nunfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters . \\nwhile ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . \\nthe synergism of the tension of ravel\\'s music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . \\nthe directing in this movie is wonderful . \\nthe actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . \\nemmanuelle beart\\'s personality is beautiful . \\nand needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . \\nbesides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . \\ni almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . \\nthe one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? \\ni have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . \\nin summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . \\nin the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . \\nin itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . \\nwhere it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . \\ni do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . \\nhowever , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . \\ni would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it . \\n',\n",
       " b\"it's wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina . \\nthe crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain . \\none half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station . \\nthe other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away . \\nthe police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads . \\nat the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act . \\nthat's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave . \\ndeceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 ) . \\nthe setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered . \\nover three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over . \\nother plot elements are thrown in for good measure . \\nwayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent . \\nbraxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate . \\nand kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful . \\nthe foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners . \\ndeceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense . \\nthe atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting . \\ndeceiver has the power to grab an audience . \\nunfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing . \\nfor , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers . \\nit's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications . \\nof course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic . \\npolice procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner . \\nbut the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details . \\ndeceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute . \\nthe pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours . \\nthe most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened . \\nmoments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks . \\nthe movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere . \\nthere are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models . \\ncinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look . \\nsome of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks . \\nas wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting . \\nroth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be . \\nthe other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren't as effective . \\nboth play their characters like familiar types . \\npenn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety . \\nsome of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors . \\nrenee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature . \\nrosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition . \\none of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience . \\nplot points aren't hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn't spelled out in bold letters . \\nthe pates give audience members credit for having brains , which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers . \\noccasionally gripping and never uninteresting , deceiver is a fine noir effort . \\n\",\n",
       " b'the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . \\nlives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment\\'s notice . \\nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . \\nmost of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . \\nit takes a pretty smart person to do that . \\nbut what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? \\nwhat if he\\'s also able to think on his feet ? \\nin fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? \\nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray\\'s the negotiator . \\nin this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . \\nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman\\'s home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . \\nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain\\'s office . \\ni don\\'t quite remember if the captain actually said , \" i hate to do this , but . . . \" , \\nalthough it wouldn\\'t surprise me if he did . \\nluckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . \\nafter being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . \\nwalsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . \\nalthough roman\\'s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . \\njackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . \\nthe actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . \\nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . \\nhow can we believe he\\'s going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? \\nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it\\'s would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson\\'s acting ability . \\nalmost every time he\\'s in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . \\nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . \\nhis is an interesting character . \\nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \\n \" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can\\'t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , \" he says . \\nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . \\nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . \\nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . \\nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . \\ngray really lucked out with this cast . \\ndavid morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . \\nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . \\nin l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . \\nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . \\nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . \\nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . \\nfortunately , this doesn\\'t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . \\nj . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . \\nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . \\nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . \\nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . \\nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . \\nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . \\nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it\\'s reality . \\nwe\\'re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . \\nas an audience , we\\'re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we\\'d like to see if one will dominate the film . \\nboth provide some pretty good entertainment . \\n',\n",
       " b'contact is the 1997 movie i\\'ve seen the most - five times to be exact . \\nfour of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it\\'s a very impressive film . \\nthe same can\\'t be said for films like independance day , but that\\'s because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn\\'t offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy . \\ncontact\\'s wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of \" merely listening \" to sounds out in space . \\nher interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) . \\nwhile everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive . \\nellie\\'s strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young . \\nin puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world\\'s overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as \" a man of the cloth , without the cloth \" . \\ndespite the vast differences in opinion regarding a \" supreme being \" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together . \\nit\\'s a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on . \\nmeanwhile , dr . david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding . \\nthis leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember . \\nit is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science . \\nwhen the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at . \\neventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) . \\nthe media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn\\'t get enough of this in forrest gump ? ) . \\nas if that weren\\'t enough , ellie\\'s discovery leads her to the nation\\'s capital where she again runs into palmer . \\ncontact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion . \\nthe impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias . \\narguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking . \\nwhen palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . \\nthe question is , can a person who doesn\\'t believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? \\neven when the film wraps up , it\\'s uncertain whether it\\'s meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where \" right and wrong \" is only opinion ( at least speaking \" politically correctly \" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong . \\nas much as it sounds like it , contact isn\\'t merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film . \\nit\\'s a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours . \\ndespite its seemingly heavy issues , it\\'s not a tedious undertaking to watch this film . \\nthe special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) \\nhighly depreciated on the small screen . \\neven so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as \" sci-fi \" . \\nthe storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it\\'s easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci-fi films i\\'ve ever seen . \\nthis is zemeckis\\' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast . \\n',\n",

you know the drill . \\nthey come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time . \\nbig deal , we\\'ve seen it all before . \\nwatching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck . \\nnow , when i say it took forever to set up the \" relationship \" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement . \\noh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring . \\nyou see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory . \\nthe two just don\\'t click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he\\'s been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced . \\nthe script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us . \\ndialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening . \\neven gibson\\'s usual gift for ad lib couldn\\'t punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry\\'s theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing . \\nunfortunately , much of what\\'s discussed in the film is not inherently important to what\\'s going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it\\'s never followed through . \\nfor example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station . \\nhe even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man\\'s lungs for chlorine . \\nthis is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him . \\nyou know what happens then ? \\nnothing , zip , nada . \\nno follow-up whatsoever , so what\\'s the significance ? \\nokay , here\\'s another one . \\na couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j . d . salinger novel \" the catcher in the rye \" . \\njerry also has a bunch of copies . \\nwhenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one . \\nleaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we\\'re never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin . \\nnot when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question . \\nthe point becomes totally extraneous . \\noh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? \\nyeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . jonas who may or may not be a bad guy . \\nthat\\'s about it . \\nfor all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he\\'s nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory . \\nyou can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi . \\nthis guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time . \\nokay , here\\'s my theory . \\nthis really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true ! \\nthe government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over . \\n',\n",

) . \\nthere\\'s much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences . \\n ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . ) \\nlucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife . \\njoaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance . \\nin the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father\\'s love or pride . \\nthroughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who\\'s scripted as a caricature of evil . \\ni\\'ve been a russell crowe fan since \" romper stomper . \" \\nthis role doesn\\'t offer him the complexities of his parts in \" l . \\na . confidential \" and \" the insider \" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre . \\nthe late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role . \\ni hope it will be rewarded with an oscar . \\nmy only major quibble with \" gladiator \" is its stylized look . \\nseveral scenes are tinted . \\nwe\\'ve seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in \" payback \" and \" the matrix . \" \\ni don\\'t get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads . \\nin \" payback \" it was merely annoying , but in \" gladiator \" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d\\'etre of the roman epic . \\n ( perhaps it\\'s meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . ) \\nalso , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously . \\n ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . ) \\nwith a more realistic look , \" gladiator \" could be even more satisfying than \" braveheart \" because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion . \\nbottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices . \\n',\n",

       " b'the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic . \\nfinding an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius . \\ncombining all that with a three-time oscar-winning director ( robert benton of \" kramer vs . \\nkramer \" ) and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment . \\nin yet another noir mystery set in hollywood -- how many of these have we seen during the past few years ? \\n-- the atmosphere is moody , the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere . \\nover-70 harry ross ( paul newman ) is a washed up cop-turned-private eye-turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life . \\nhe\\'s screwed up things pretty well ( \" i had a wife and daughter . \\nnow , i\\'m a drunk ) and is at a crossroads . \\na couple of years ago , he traveled to mexico to bring back mel ( reese witherspoon ) , the under-age daughter of jack ( gene hackman ) and catherine ( susan sarandon ) ames and now lives with them . \\nthe ames are former movie stars , past their prime and the three have become fast friends . \\none gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up . \\nto fill his time , he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine . \\njack is in even worse shape than harry . \\nhe\\'s dying of cancer with only a year to live . \\nthings do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him . \\ninstead of the routine errand that ross expects , he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex-cop who is , himself , full of bloody holes . \\nthis unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine\\'s first husband 20 years before . \\nthrough a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder ; blackmail ; guns ; mel\\'s mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ; ross\\'s former cop buddies , ex-lover and would-be sidekick , the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to . \\nit\\'s a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale , but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about . \\nthe only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario . \\nby the time they show you , it doesn\\'t matter . \\nthe storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross\\'s relationship with rubin ( giancarlo esposito ) , a partner wannabe . \\nthese scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief , however they are neither . \\nrubin and ross have some past relationship but either it\\'s not explained or i didn\\'t care enough at that point to remember . \\na running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform . \\nit\\'s also not funny , doesn\\'t connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course . \\non the positive side , it\\'s often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen . \\nthe three leads all have well-deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished , if not extraordinary jobs . \\nnewman is a grand actor , but doesn\\'t seem quite suited to the dark film style . \\nhe is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out . \\nhackman , also low-key , is believable but lacks sparkle . \\nsarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one-dimensional . \\nthe actors do what they can with lame dialog , but they can\\'t pull the film out of the hole it\\'s dug for itself . \\njames garner who plays ross\\'s old buddy ex-cop raymond hope is always a treat , but even he half-heartedly struggles through lines like \" i\\'m glad they didn\\'t shoot your pecker off . \" \\nthe best part of the film is the look at old friends , how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make . \\nthe genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen \\nthe film doesn\\'t run very long before the audience realizes that it\\'s hopeless . \\nthe only reason for watching is the actors . \\nit reminds me of disaster movies such as \" towering inferno \" where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the film\\'s problems . \\nin a better world , there would have been second-rate actors in this second-rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better . \\nof course , we don\\'t live in that better world , but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie . \\n',\n",

       " b'the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola\\'s 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . \\nmartin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . \\nunfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola\\'s influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . \\nseventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . \\nthis film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . \\ngoodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . \\nthe book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . \\nat the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . \\nafter couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . \\nthree of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . \\nwealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . \\nbut the perfect world of \" wiseguys \" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy\\'s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy\\'s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry\\'s own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . \\ngoodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . \\nscorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . \\nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . \\nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . \\nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . \\nscorsese also manages to break viewer\\'s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . \\nwith the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character\\'s dialogue or narrator\\'s commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . \\neven if we don\\'t pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . \\nfirst , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie\\'s ironic prologue . \\nthen , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . \\nthis multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . \\nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . \\nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . \\nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . \\nhowever , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . \\nsuch scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . \\nfragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn\\'t have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . \\nhe uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious \" a day in life \" segment near the end of the film . \\nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . \\nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . \\njoe pesci deserved his \" oscar \" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . \\nray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn\\'t look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . \\nliotta\\'s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . \\nliotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . \\nlorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . \\npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . \\nas a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . \\nbecause of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s . \\n',\n",

       " b'these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes . \\nbut , only a few years ago , before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice , sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers . \\nsequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south . \\nthe way to regain popularity and prestige , they thought , was the use the same formulas , characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place . \\none of such celebrity was eddie murphy , black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade . \\nin order to return to the spotlight , he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film , beverly hills cop , 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 . \\nseven years later , for the third instalment , he used the directorial service of john landis , another fading star , with whom he successfully collaborated twice - in trading places and coming to america . \\nthis time , however , third time wasn\\'t the charm and beverly hills iii was failure . \\neddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback . \\neddie murphy here plays axel foley , fast-talking streetwise detroit policeman , who raids illegal chop shop . \\nthe routine police action ends in tragedy , when the criminals kill foley\\'s boss . \\ndetermined to bring the killers to justice , foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald ( timothy carhart ) . \\nwhen it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles , foley goes back to los angeles . \\nthere , with the help of his old friend , local policeman rosewood ( judge rheinhold ) , foley would clash with money counterfeit ring . \\nten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different . \\nin this decade , the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills , which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film , simply doesn\\'t work . \\nscreenwriter steven e . de souza provides another conflict , this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business-like professionalism of the bad guys . \\nsince foley belongs to the former , his character had to watch his language , and the tone of the film in general is more infantile . \\nunfortunately , this film still belongs to action movie genre , and there is too much violence for little children . \\nnice example is the humorous scene in the beginning , which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath . \\nunlike donner with the lethal weapon series , landis simply can\\'t balance the comedy with \" regular \" action , and the result is a film that fails in both aspects . \\naction scenes are sometimes interesting , but not too spectacular ( at the end , scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself ) ; humour , on the other hand , falls flat . \\nto make even worse , some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure ( especially art expert turned into arms dealer , played by bronson pinchot ) . \\nin the end , although the film provided some entertainment , viewers , at least critical ones , would probably be happy to know that there aren\\'t any plans for beverly hills iv . \\n',\n",

' \\nalong those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions . \\nby no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same . \\nsimon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come . \\nin the present , however , it's an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at . \\n\",\n",

       " b' \" america\\'s sweethearts \" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn\\'t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . \\nalmost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting \" comic relief \" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) . \\ncrystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . \\n \" america\\'s sweethearts \" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . \\nit\\'s a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation . \\nby the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . \\njohn cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . \\nof the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled \" time over time , \" are far from rosy . \\nwhile eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen\\'s solo films have tanked . \\nto make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a \" visionary \" who purchased the unabomber\\'s cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . \\ndesperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation . \\nlee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . \\nhe enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen\\'s sister , personal assistant and whipping girl . \\nwhat lee doesn\\'t know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness . \\npress junkets are a haven for control freaks . \\nstudios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand . \\ngenerally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel . \\nthe next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . \\nevery 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . \\nthe atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets . \\nrepresentatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . \\nthey get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges . \\nthe \" reporters \" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . \\nplacing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit . \\nthe junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . \\nfor most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press . \\nwhen they do deal with journalists , the \" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters \" premise is de-clawed . \\ngwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions . \\nlee certainly isn\\'t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . \\nis the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? \\nhell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . \\nall of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in \" america\\'s sweethearts \" is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn\\'t matter because any publicity is good publicity . \\nand thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . \\nso what about the cast ? \\njulia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) . \\ncatherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic . \\nby casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on \" comic relief \" - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks . \\nin supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed \" too broad . \" \\nseth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with . \\ncome to think of it , \" little to work with \" is the operative phrase for this movie . \\nas a hollywood satire , \" america\\'s sweethearts \" is toothless . \\nas a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure . \\nsuch a good cast , such a waste of their efforts . \\nhad it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been \" much ado about nothing . \" \\n',\n",

       " b\"this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle . \\ntarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far . \\nbadly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . \\ni have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . \\nfurthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence . \\nand , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . \\nof course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line . \\nimagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like . \\nwith its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse . \\nanyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect . \\nthe only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) . \\nthe film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough . \\ninstead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) . \\nhe is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble . \\nmeanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization . \\non the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals . \\none shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help . \\nwith lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born . \\nits patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability . \\nwith his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal . \\nhis pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off . \\njane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her . \\nsome six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover . \\nsince then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency . \\ntarzan continues this trend . \\nmarch may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act . \\nmeanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy . \\ninstead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance . \\nthe story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies . \\nthe problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless . \\nthe romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance . \\nthe special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) . \\nand , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals . \\nover the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material . \\nthe most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) . \\nweismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number . \\nand , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . \\n\",\n",

       " b\"stendhal's syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder . \\ngrim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy's master of the horror thriller dario argento . \\nboasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento . \\nit follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980's . \\nbased on the novel by graziella magherini , the film stars argento's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer . \\nvisiting florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail . \\nat the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints . \\nposing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins . \\na gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento's often lumpy narratives . \\nthe stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario . \\nit is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's psychological disintegration . \\nthe script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers . \\nbut as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years . \\nargento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences . \\neffects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent . \\nthe film's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style . \\nproof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world's most exhilarating filmmakers . \\nthe cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless . \\nasia argento's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating . \\nit's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts . \\nthomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo , and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest . \\nbut perhaps the stendhal syndrome's single most striking element is ennio morricone's soundtrack . \\nactive since the 1960's , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts . \\nit's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards . \\nit's been three decades since argento and morricone worked together . \\nthis is a long welcome reunion . \\nif the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn't quite reach a completely satisfying climax . \\nbut by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento's career . \\n * note : see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can . \\ndubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web . \\n\",\n",

       " b'one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet\\'s \" gloria , \" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre . \\nsuddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in . \\nwhen a movie is over , aren\\'t we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ? \\ni thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn\\'t have been anything to talk about in the first place . \\nto be sure , \" gloria \" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy\\'s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it . \\nright before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . \\neventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . \\nmeanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn\\'t commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime . \\nwhen he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude . \\ngloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don\\'t they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with . \\nthe previous incarnation of \" gloria \" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can\\'t really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars . \\nthere is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn\\'t completely unbearable to watch . \\ni liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . \\nthese bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers . \\nthroughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , \" who really cares ? \" \\nas gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn\\'t sound realistic at all . \\nin the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone\\'s performance was , but as the film progressed she got better . \\nalthough not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored . \\njean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag . \\nall other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria\\'s friend whom she turns to for help . \\nsony , the studio that released \" gloria , \" obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don\\'t blame them . \\nthey declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved . \\nalthough how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular \" in dreams , \" which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion \" gloria \" is going to vanish from theaters faster than \" ishtar , \" judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself . \\nalthough stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995\\'s \" casino \" or 1996\\'s \" last dance \" if you don\\'t believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of \" gloria \" was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" mandingo \" has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , \" a trashy potboiler \" that \" appeals only to the s&m crowd . \" \\nactually , i think \" mandingo \" is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts . \\nit\\'s too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash . \\nthe story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) . \\none day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) . \\nalthough the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley . \\naccording to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves . \\nhammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him . \\nhammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves . \\nmeanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild . \\nhammond , however , is happier spending nights with his \" bed wench , \" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex . \\nit is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche . \\nhammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had \" pleasured \" her before he did . \\nof course , it\\'s fine that he\\'s slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a \" white lady , \" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her . \\nso blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen . \\nblanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child . \\nhammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it\\'s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche . \\nhammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water . \\nyes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive . \\njudging only by the plot , \" mandingo \" is pure sexploitation . \\nthe main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society . \\nwhen \" mandingo \" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs . \\ndramatically , \" mandingo \" is weak and unfocused , and historically it\\'s mostly confused . \\nif one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics . \\nnot once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants . \\nthe men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner . \\nthere is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but \" mandingo\\'s \" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there\\'s plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) . \\nsome tried to write off \" mandingo \" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it\\'s not that easy . \\n \" mandingo \" was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as \" the bible \" ( 1966 ) , the remake of \" king kong \" ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated \" dune \" ( 1984 ) . \\nthe director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" ( 1954 ) and \" fantastic voyage \" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as \" the narrow margin \" ( 1952 ) . \\nthe script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on \" serpico . \" \\njames mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career . \\nso why is \" mandingo \" so bad ? \\na number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job . \\nwexler\\'s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( \" yessuh , massuh \" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( \" fer whut\\'re you gittin\\' outta bed ? \" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( \" if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! \" ) . \\nfleischer\\'s direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable . \\nnevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due . \\ndespite its exploitative nature , \" mandingo \" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery . \\nuntil then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery . \\neven classics such as \" gone with the wind \" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter . \\n \" mandingo \" reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn\\'t all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets . \\nbut all this is constantly undermined by the film\\'s negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . \\nwith a little more maturity and different handling , \" mandingo \" might have been an effective , worthwhile film . \\nwhile it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them . \\nthe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler\\'s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing . \\nthere is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but \" mandingo \" never does it . \\nsteven spielberg touched on that same topic in \" schindler\\'s list \" ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid . \\nthe difference between that film and \" mandingo \" is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma . \\n \" mandingo \" is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its \" trashy potboiler \" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished . \\n',\n",

       " b\"nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . \\nthe opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . \\nthe prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . \\nif the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . \\ncage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . \\nand thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . \\ncage should have known what he was getting himself into . \\nhe got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . \\nthe critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . \\nin the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . \\nthat sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . \\nwhile the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . \\naudiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . \\nin fact , the marketing people are counting on it . \\nno one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . \\ndirector simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . \\nwhat he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . \\na bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . \\nif either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . \\nat a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . \\ntheir tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . \\nin fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . \\nit is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . \\nwhile malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . \\nhis recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . \\nit doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . \\nthere's a word for people like you , nicolas . \\nthat word is called recidivist . . . repeat \\noffender . \\n\",\n",

\\nand how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ? \\ni can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment . \\nthe most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence . \\nthe character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated . \\na priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken . \\nhe picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever . \\nwhen she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her . \\nthe presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her . \\nwhen it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ . \\nthe box for the film claims \" because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 . \\ncontains nudity and graphic violence \" . \\nwhile both is certainly true , there doesn\\'t seem to be much of either in any large amounts . \\nbesides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi-graphic self-surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety . \\nas for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident . \\nice from the sun has been released on vhs by www . b-movie . com . \\nit has been presented in in full-frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8mm ) is pretty decent . \\nbesides the decent soundtrack ( which is also available from www . b-movie . com ) , a making-of video is also available called on thin ice . \\ni haven\\'t had the opportunity to see the documentary , but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed , if only to see how director eric stanze ( director of a similar cult film called savage harvest ) , conducted the atmosphere on set . \\n',\n",

       " b'director luis mandoki\\'s last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama \" when a man loves a woman , \" but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture , \" message in a bottle , \" which is the worst type of romance , a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up . \\neverything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and much better---so there\\'s an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , \" meaningful \" statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through . \\n \" message in a bottle \" begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day . \\ninside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper . \\nsoon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message . \\nof course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa\\'s age and played by kevin costner . \\nshe is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett\\'s late wife who died a few years earlier . \\ndo you think you know where this is headed ? \\nmost likely you do , and i wouldn\\'t call it giving away anything to say that by the picture\\'s end , the movie has fallen into deep , artificial melodrama that i didn\\'t buy for a second . \\nif there are any positive things to say about \" message in a bottle , \" it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett\\'s stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , \" shaggy dog \" love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city . \\nmeanwhile , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has made recently . \\nit seems that with such bad luck , he wouldn\\'t want to make another movie set near water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridiculous , centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea . \\nthe other actors are all , sadly , wasted , including illeana douglas , an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the \" friend \" roles , here playing penn\\'s confidante and co-worker at the tribune . \\nthe first half of \" message in a bottle \" plays like a hum-drum , trite television movie for the lifetime channel , as theresa spends a great deal of time \" getting to know \" garrett , with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining . \\nusually , i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships , but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt \" written , \" and not as if people were really \" talking . \" \\nwhen the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other , and are not particularly interesting themselves , you know immediately that you are in trouble . \\ni swear that while watching \" message in a bottle , \" i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater ( heck , in actuality i\\'m not even familiar to the novel this is based on , by nicholas sparks ) . \\nalways one step ahead of the characters , the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing . \\nnobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa\\'s secret , and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after . \\nthis same exact problem occurred in last year\\'s very , very similar ( watch this , and you will realize just how similar i mean ) meg ryan-nicolas cage romantic drama , \" city of angels . \" \\nalthough theresa is deeply touched by the \" heartfelt \" letter that she finds in the bottle , perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own , preferably before filming began . \\nit should have read , \" memo to screenwriters : use you brain ! \" \\n',\n",

       " b'contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan\\'s only novel . \\nit details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) . \\nwe first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project . \\nher research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains \" pure research \" in favor of science with \" commercial applications . \\nshe goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s . r . \\nhadden ( john hurt ) . \\nthen , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal . \\nin the movie\\'s most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega . \\nat first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before . \\nfurther decoding , with hadden\\'s help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine . \\nit appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens\\' home world . \\nof course , the big question becomes \" who gets to ride it ? \" \\n ( right after \" who\\'s gonna pay for this thing ? \" ) . \\nto boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith . \\ndrumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep \" godless science \" from talking to god , or something like that ) . \\nthen hadden reappears with startling news . \\nhe has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest . \\nellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse ) . \\nwhen she returns home , no one believes her . \\nshe was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours . \\nher story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who don\\'t even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static . \\n . \\n . \\neighteen hours worth of static ) . \\nthere is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first . \\nellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working . \\nneither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that\\'s a tough standard to meet . \\nellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures . \\nher real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally . \\ndrumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble . \\nhadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board . \\neven palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie\\'s love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses . \\nthe film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine . \\nthe part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain . \\nthe film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion . \\nthis is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved . \\nthe film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith . \\nreligious people are presented as shallow caricatures . \\nrob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right . \\nanother religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey ) . \\nthe only really fleshed-out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague . \\ni can\\'t even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian . \\nall we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex . \\nthe film drops the science ball at the very end , when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith . \\nin a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist \" religious \" doctrine , this is exactly the wrong message to send . \\nin a movie dealing with issues of science and faith , the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism . \\nwhat ellie should have said was , \" you shouldn\\'t believe me . \\nnot without evidence , and i don\\'t have the evidence . \\ni know what happened but you shouldn\\'t take my word alone . \" \\nthat is the voice of science speaking . \\nthe character of david drumlin is another problem with this film . \\nhis attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position . \\nalso , his profession of \" faith \" before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it . \\nthe last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles . \\nthe media figures , such as bernard shaw and jay leno aren\\'t so bad , in as much as their participation was voluntary . \\nthe use of bill clinton , however , should give anyone pause . \\nfirst of all , lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line , thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken , is just plain creepy . \\nalso , using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 , forever dating it . \\npeople watching this film in the future will say , \" hey , this never took place during clinton\\'s term . \" \\nthis bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief . \\nalso , the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century . \\nbetter to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all . \\nthe film does raise an interesting question , although it never develops it in a satisfying way . \\nif we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture , would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god , or at least some form of supernatural creator ? \\npersonally , i would hope not , since religion is basically an

       " b\"after a stylistic detour with mrs . \\nparker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . \\nwhile these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . \\nit is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . \\nuntil mrs . \\nparker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . \\ni found equinox , his last pre- mrs . \\nparker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . \\ni was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . \\nthere are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . \\nthe characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . \\nin short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in . \\nafterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . \\njeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . \\nfor her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . \\nall she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating . \\nafter he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . \\nthe other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne . \\na mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . \\nthey remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . \\nthe landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . \\nthe four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . \\nthe two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool . \\nmeanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . \\nthe romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . \\nsex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . \\nultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . \\nthe greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . \\njonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman . \\nthose who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . \\nlara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . \\nnick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease . \\nthe clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis . \\nher often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars . \\ni don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions . \\nenough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . \\nafterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . \\nthe plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture . \\nrudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction . \\n\",\n",

       " b' \" mercury rising \" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . \\nthat\\'s right . \\nthe major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . \\nthis central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . \\nhis name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . \\nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . \\nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of \" mercury rising . \" \\ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon\\'s character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . \\nmiko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he\\'s touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . \\nit\\'s a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn\\'t playing like he\\'s autistic . \\nunlike dustin hoffman\\'s performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio\\'s in \" what\\'s eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . \\nhowever , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character\\'s autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . \\nhell , he doesn\\'t even have to be shy . \\nin fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis\\' arm . \\nwillis\\' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . \\nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon\\'s house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . \\nof course , we know that isn\\'t the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents . \\nsimon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . \\njeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . \\nthis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon\\'s parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . \\nlate in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . \\nof all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . \\ni can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey\\'s character is far too accommodating . \\nnot only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o\\'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . \\nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . \\nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" doesn\\'t rise to the challenge . \\nthe movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . \\nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . \\nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it\\'s more suspenseful that way . \\ntaken as a whole , \" mercury rising \" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . \\nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . \\nthis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . \\nmaybe the book was better , but the way it\\'s handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore . \\n',\n",

true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made . \\ncorey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life . \\none day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him . \\nher name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion . \\nmaggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another . \\nthey gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover . \\nlucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend . \\nthis is not clear to lucas , however . \\nhe still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen . \\nwe soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally . \\nthey throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie . \\nsurprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school . \\nthe next scene is brilliant . \\nmaggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally . \\nshe tries to talk to him as if nothing happened . \\nhe rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion . \\nin lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters . \\nbut maggie is written smarter than that . \\nshe understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him . \\nnext we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) . \\nhe is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend . \\nwhat's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks . \\nof course anyone with a brain can tell what's gonna happen next . \\ncappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas' relationship . \\nthis begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone . \\nshe's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt . \\nmaggie is charmed by cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body . \\nthis scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires . \\ndesperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room . \\nit's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene ) . \\nlucas finally figures out what's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance . \\nthis causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team . \\nthe last third of the film revolves around this attempt . \\nwhile the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not . \\nthere are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up . \\ndave grusin's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps . \\nlucas is filled with great performances . \\nforget everything you know about corey haim . \\nback in 1986 he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain . \\nkerri green is very appealing as maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her . \\nsheen's cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas . \\nthere are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti's ben , a friend of lucas , whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks . \\nalso turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina , the girl who admires lucas from afar . \\nwhen people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s , you hear john hughes this and john hughes that . \\nlucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so-called classics . \\nbut hopefully , like with heathers and say anything , lucas can begin to find it's own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald .

       " b'ok , let\\'s get one thing straight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it\\'s not too bad , really . \\nit\\'s the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean-claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo\\'s maiden hollywood effort , hard target ) . \\nin lam\\'s film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians . \\nthese russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn\\'t be noticed ) . \\nthis brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . . well , \\nyou know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don\\'t have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) . \\nmoreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) . \\nin little odessa , he meets mikhail\\'s girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) . \\nthis film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think . \\nafter all , one thing that\\'s been missing from woo\\'s hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) . \\nmovies like this shouldn\\'t be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too \" big \" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle . \\nmaximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don\\'t overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) . \\nthe emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don\\'t make a hell of a lot of sense ) . \\nin fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv\\'s \" kids in the hall \" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story . \\nunfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . . well , \\nyou\\'ll see . \\nthe movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots . \\none is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka . \\nanother , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw . \\nand even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint . \\nof course , the movie does have its share of silliness . \\nfor example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he\\'s getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head . \\nin an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become . \\nbut what has he become ? \\na tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ? \\ndoesn\\'t sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre . \\nbut let\\'s face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly . \\nso maximum risk is a little different from most other action films . \\nwhile watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics . \\nbut watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there\\'s not much left . \\nalthough it\\'s short on spectacle , lam\\'s film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think . \\ni\\'m more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that\\'s a good sign . \\ngo see maximum risk , but don\\'t expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong-hollywood action movie . \\nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\ndr t . white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore , but we don\\'t hold this against him . \\n',\n",

\\neven better . \\nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers\\' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as \" schizophrenia , \" and so forth . \\nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers\\' fire , proving that some people just couldn\\'t take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . \\nyes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn\\'t funny . \\nit\\'s not for lack of trying . \\nthe farrellys utilize in \" me , myself & irene \" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . \\nthis , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . \\nsoon enough , charlie\\'s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . \\nthis guy isn\\'t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he\\'s been insulted , or holding a little girl\\'s head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . \\nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . \\nsome have suggested that this isn\\'t a problem , because the farrelly brothers\\' brand of humor doesn\\'t require plot to work . \\nthey\\'re wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys\\' last effort , 1996\\'s \" there\\'s something about mary . \" \\n ( 1999\\'s \" outside providence \" was technically an earlier project . ) \\nthe brothers\\' earlier film wasn\\'t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . \\nin \" mary , \" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they\\'d have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . \\n \" me , myself & irene , \" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at \" mary \" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . \\nhaving been produced by the same guys who made \" mary , \" \" irene \" seems like an even bigger disappointment . \\nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . \\nbut they haven\\'t come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of \" me , myself & irene \" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . \\nthe plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who\\'s in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that\\'s entirely predictable from the get-go . \\n ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? \\nyeah , me too . ) \\nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \\ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \\nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \\ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \\nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \\nbut by the end of the film , they\\'re still doing the same schitck ; it hasn\\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\\'t been dropped either . \\nthat\\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \\n \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . \\nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\\'s actions . \\nthis doesn\\'t really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\\'s condition early on , so they don\\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \\nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn\\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \\njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" \\nit\\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \\ncarrey doesn\\'t pull any stunts we don\\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\\' script doesn\\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\\'t set up in any meaningful way . \\nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \\nzellweger\\'s irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \\nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \\nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . \\nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \\nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \\nafter viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \\nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \\nbut i don\\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \\nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\\'ll rebound just fine . \\neven after that happens , though , i\\'ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high-caliber misfire . \\n',\n",

\\ni know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror . \\ncome on , the guy looks like the gorton\\'s fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate . \\nthough his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that\\'s * really * saying something . \\nso , all that\\'s left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy . \\nboth prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene . \\nhewitt , however , does do a post-shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite . \\n . \\n . titillating . \\nthis scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars under my rating system . \\notherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves . \\nearly in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas . \\nshe and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever . \\ni needed extra-strength tylenol after that part . \\noh , and the film\\'s conclusion , talk about repetitive ! \\npeople who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know\\'s ending at least 5 minutes before it happens . \\nboring ! \\ni saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater . \\nadmission is only one dollar on wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them . \\nit\\'s usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience , who don\\'t seem to mind participating in a mass \" mystery science theater 3000 \" -type viewing . \\ni still know what you did last summer , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is . \\nif it weren\\'t for the main actresses\\' revealing wardrobes , i\\'d have had a very , very hard time sitting through this lame sequel . \\ni can\\'t imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and wouldn\\'t recommend it to people , unless they\\'re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy . \\ni read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works . \\nwhat a depressing thought . \\nhewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act . \\nrated r , this film contains lots of violence , several gory scenes , and a couple nubile , horny teenagers--though the sex act itself is always thwarted . \\ni\\'d say this is unsuitable for kids , but teens wouldn\\'t have a problem sitting through it , especially since they obviously compose the film\\'s target audience . \\n',\n",

       " b'shakespeare . you hardly understood it in high school . \\nwhy would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn\\'t count on it ? \\nif this is your attitude , then i\\'ll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh\\'s hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now . \\nif , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark . \\nnamely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king\\'s brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play . \\nhis suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother\\'s hands . \\nhamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery . . . . and \\nthe game is afoot . . . . \\nthe first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes . \\nwith external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established . \\ninterior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers . \\nthe hamlet castle\\'s grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft . \\ncostuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination . . \\nnot quite the denmark of the 1600\\'s , the characters\\' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel . \\nit is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively . \\nin addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character . \\nas the revenge-driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows . \\nfrom the anticipation of seeing his father\\'s ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades . \\nevery scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh\\'s acting and directing as to shakespeare\\'s manuscript . \\nhamlet seems to be a who\\'s who of shakespearean-trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself . \\njulie christie , as hamlet\\'s mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players . \\nkate winslet as hamlet\\'s lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character\\'s plummet to the depths of dispair and madness . \\nrichard briers as ophelia\\'s father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing . \\nnicholas farrell as hamlet\\'s trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two-timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast . \\nhamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible . \\nin some cases , this made for interesting scenes . \\nbilly crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well . \\ncrystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene . \\nhowever , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all . \\nas the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba . \\npart of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time . \\nhis off-camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well-voiced actor . \\ni wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention . \\nunfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions . \\njack lemmon , an excellent actor , just can\\'t do shakespeare . \\nas marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet\\'s ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him . \\ngerard depardieu , another talented actor , is wasted when given little more than the utterances of \" yes , my lord \" and \" no , my lord \" in the role of reynaldo . \\nrichard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk-on role , showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador . \\ni think he had two lines . \\nthen there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway . \\nwhen i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was . \\nif bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you . \\nhamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one . \\nbranagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback-type images . \\nthis only works about half the time , and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them . \\nyou don\\'t have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare , but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly . \\nthe alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar , the high school english course . \\nin it , you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king\\'s english . \\nor i suppose you could just read the cliff notes .

       " b'in 1994 , an insider\\'s look at a scandal-ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton\\'s 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship ) . \\nnow , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever . \\nbut the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president . \\nit is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics . \\njack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination . \\nhe is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) . \\nthe film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton\\'s ideals and helps to organize the campaign . \\nhe joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) . \\ngovernor stanton\\'s past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage . \\nto help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend , libby \" the dustbuster \" holden ( kathy bates ) . \\nthe acting throughout primary colors is superb . \\nit would be worth seeing the movie for bates\\' wild performance alone . \\nshe enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance . \\ntravolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little . \\nemma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can\\'t let anything show that might hurt the presidential run . \\nthe problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom . \\nprimary colors treads lightly on this issue . \\nthough stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues . \\nin fact , most of the \" bad guys \" are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house . \\nrather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control . \\nalthough the film strays into some obviously non-clinton territory , it is difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president\\'s current troubles ) . \\nprimary colors\\' chief problem is its length . \\nit runs about 15 minutes too long . \\nthere are some scenes which could have easily been cut . \\nfor example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists . \\nthe scene\\'s only apparent purpose is to establish stanton\\'s character , which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film . \\nthe extra length isn\\'t long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying , but it mars an otherwise excellent film . \\nrepublicans , democrats , and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors . \\nit\\'s a funny , and at some times shocking , look at the modern political process . \\n',\n",
       " b'when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . \\nthe first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . \\nthe latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . \\ndecades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . \\nyes , most of the kung fu and other \" martial arts \" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . \\nbut , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . \\nthe best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . \\nmade in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee\\'s skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . \\nit succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . \\nlee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . \\nhe is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . \\ninterpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . \\nlee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o\\'harra , han\\'s brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee\\'s sister years ago . \\nthe island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . \\nthe plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . \\nthe main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . \\non the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . \\nin the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . \\nthe latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee\\'s acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . \\nalthough two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . \\nit is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . \\nother actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . \\nfighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . \\nin many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . \\ni\\'m not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can\\'t avoid to appreciate the difference from today\\'s movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . \\nso , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don\\'t like that particular genre . \\n',\n",
       " b'of circumcision , psychic wounds and the family sitcom \\nthe opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film . \\nthere\\'s a guy\\'s voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like , and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women . \\nas his imagination plays o n , he ( and we ) picture these motley characters in a mix-and-match shuffle of unlikely marriages , businesswomen with bums , matrons with paint salesmen , the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy . \\nit\\'s not just a witty , funny summing up of the film \\'s themes - you might not guess it yet , but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on . \\nwhat starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction , gets taken on a road trip , put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash . \\nthat may not sound so different from the average family sitcom , and the general idea of the film doesn\\'t , at first , seem so wildly distant from standard-issue hollywood comedy : man who was adopted as a child ( ben still er ) sets out on a journey to meet his real parents , along with his wife ( patricia arquette ) , his baby , and a pretty psychology-researcher ( tea leoni ) in tow . \\nvarious mix-ups , shenanigans , oddball characters and , yup , disasters follow . \\nbut if you think you\\'ve been here before , the dialogue and the direction ( by david o . russell , who made spanking the monkey ) take it into another dimension . \\nthe dreaded t-name seems an inevitable reference point ( what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance ) but really the point is that the foot-massage master hasn\\'t got a monopoly on plot twists and fast , funny , irreverent lines , or on the absurdities of ordinary speech . \\nwhether it\\'s about circumcision , psychic wounds , oral sex , carjacking , the beauties of the armpit area , or ronald reagan , the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention . \\nthe best thing is how these words aren\\'t just there for the punchlines , but are great precisely because they\\'re said in character , like tea leoni\\'s neurotically-charged psychobabbler who\\'s able to say under assault , \" it\\'s understandable if you find this threatening \" . \\nthe cast is excellent throughout , and , rather than singling out anybody , kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting , with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission . \\nthere are some elements of a woody allen film in this ( not to mention the hand-held camera and loose , improvisational feel of some scenes ) . \\nlike allen , russell\\'s interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children ( and everybody , really ) . \\nstill , if you\\'re expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la \" murphy brown \" / \" frasier \" / fill-in-the-blank-american-comedy , well , it won\\'t happen . \\nthe film sets up expectations like these , with the lead character\\'s search f or his origins and his hopes of self-healing , only to knock them down . \\nif the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one-ness , flirting with disaster\\'s charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go . \\nand that , the film suggests , is the essential family state - and you better learn to love it . \\nsomehow , this is perversely feelgood cinema , right up to its manic end . \\n',\n",

g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned . \\nas he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other . \\nwhen dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , \" because they had guns , and we didn\\'t . \" \\nrational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others\\' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power . \\ndr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss . \\nfirst , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father . \\nnext , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities . \\nthrough his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self-respect , and defines himself only by his pistol . \\nalong the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith . \\nas domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching . \\nlast , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who hasn\\'t spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her . \\nsayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in \" men with guns . \" \\n ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . ) \\nhe creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr . fuentes and domingo . \\ntheir uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film\\'s overarching theme of violence as power - domingo\\'s attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes\\' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is isn\\'t ) . \\nthe setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself . \\nsayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth-century coal mining town in \" matewan \" ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in \" lone star \" ( 1996 ) . \\nsayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( \" gattaca \" ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain . \\nsayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects . \\nthe one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border . \\nit would not be a stretch to say that \" men with guns \" is a depressing film . \\nin fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure . \\nin addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine , or padre portillo\\'s inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being . \\nnevertheless , it is bleak material sayles has chosen , and he deals with it accordingly . \\nthe last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope , even in a world where , as one character puts it , \" nobody refuses the men with guns . \" \\n',\n",
       " b'writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) \\nstarring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso \\ni suppose i\\'m not extremely surprised that \" virus \" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it\\'s an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron\\'s early works . \\nin fact , \" virus \" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the \" aliens \" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . \\nno such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron\\'s wing for years and years , i\\'m beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . \\nin fact , \" virus \" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like \" virus \" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . \\nthe film seems to not only borrow it\\'s plot from last year\\'s similarly-fated \" deep rising , \" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the \\'80s called \" leviathan , \" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part \" alien , \" part john carpenter\\'s twisted remake of \" the thing . \" \\n \" virus , \" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . \\nthey get on . \\nthey break up into pairs and investigate . \\nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . \\nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . \\nof its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . \\nand it\\'s not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even \" aliens \" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don\\'t give a damn . \\ni almost don\\'t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he\\'s a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . \\nlike anthony hopkins for \" legends of the fall \" ( the line \" scrooooooo \\'em \" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . \\nor peter o\\'toole in \" caligula . \" \\ngreat actor , horrific performance . \\nit happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland\\'s career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . \\nthough it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone\\'s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it\\'s laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . \\n \" virus \" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , \" if it\\'s dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . \" \\nand if you don\\'t believe me , go back and rent \" godzilla , \" and tell me if there\\'s even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don\\'t really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . \\nbut all of this doesn\\'t matter since \" virus \" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . \\nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i\\'ve ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn\\'t figure it out when i saw it ) . \\nimagine the first attack of the aliens in \" aliens , \" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that\\'s basically the whole of \" virus \" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . \\nand my god , it\\'s a long damn sit . \\nwith no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it\\'s a wonder that it even got made . \\nwe already know that big movie studios\\' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like \" out of sight \" and \" saving private ryan \" give you more faith in them , but movies like \" virus \" manage to drain a little more out of the pool . \\ni almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . \\nthey read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . \\neven though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i\\'d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . \\nin fact , shouts of \" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? \" \\nare not only justifiable , but encouraged . \\n',\n",

       " b\"depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line . \\nnew line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . \\nthe fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . \\nit also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . \\nthis time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico . \\nby all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border . \\none is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . \\ncalling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side . \\nbut smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them . \\nviewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations . \\nthere is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire . \\ndirector walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . \\nwhat he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction . \\nyes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . \\nthe problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . \\nthey were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . \\nwith john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive . \\nit feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work . \\nthe narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence . \\neven if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . \\nwillis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . \\nchristopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . \\nwith no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . \\ncinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration . \\nsometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . \\nin the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"at first i was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer , but that was before i saw the film . \\nnow my view has completely changed . \\nit's time to embrace for impact , because this is a very bumpy ride . \\nthe story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including : jason nesmith ( tim allen ) , alexander dane ( alan rickman ) , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) signing autographs at a convention . \\nthey meet fans who dress up in costumes , fans who worship the ground they walk on , and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris ( robin sachs ) . \\nof course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties , and meet the ugly aliens themselves . \\nthus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians . \\nthe movie plays like a really bad star trek episode , in fact it's worse . \\ni don't even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof , because quite frankly it's just not funny . \\nall the jokes are basically collected observations from the series . \\none such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space , because no extra on the tv show ever lives , as proven in the star trek series . \\ncreative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea , but not when they are used to death . \\na person can only take so much . \\nwe do not need to be tortured , especially when you have to pay for it . \\nit's pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful . \\nit's not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him , but a few laughs would have been helpful . \\nspeaking of acting , 2 fine talents were wasted as well . \\nsigourney weaver was here to show cleavage , well at least it worked . \\nit's pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage . \\nit just shows you how disgraceful the film really is . \\nalan rickman however was not so lucky . \\nafter his last hit ( dogma ) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess . \\nit's just a shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away . \\nwhen the film couldn't get any worse , thankfully some nice special effects pop up . \\nlike many big blockbusters ( armageddon , the haunting to name a few ) they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film's box office results . \\ntimes it works , but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk . \\nwhen will it stop ? \\ni am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash . \\nit may look fine and dandy , but we need to at least have a story . \\nis that too much to ask ? \\nobviously it is . \\nwhen galaxy quest finally ends , it literally crash lands . \\naside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic , it's an embarrassment to the cast , and it's embarrassing to the science fiction genre . \\nit's not the least bit fun , nor was it entertaining . \\nthe only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond . \\n\",\n",
       " b'the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : \" it mu5t be found . \" \\nso what , exactly , is the fifth element ? \\nafter seeing luc besson\\'s ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think . \\nbut what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen . \\nthe biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film . \\nspeaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it . \\nfiguring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson\\'s the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) . \\nall of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest . \\nwhat remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain . \\nthe look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last . \\nthe frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film . \\nbut it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren\\'t equally as interesting , and are they ever . \\nin addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna\\'s pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour . \\ngaulthier\\'s outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson\\'s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film . \\nwhile besson\\'s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience . \\nfor all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre . \\ni really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed . \\nat first this character\\'s hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly . \\nnot irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno . \\nthe tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra\\'s innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring . \\nthen there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot . \\nthe story\\'s weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element . \\nwhile still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be . \\nthe big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward . \\nas such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters . \\nthis suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the \" enemy \" --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made . \\nstill , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmaker\\'s original vision come to the screen in all its audacious , undiluted glory . \\nit is a fascinating example of how of one artist\\'s fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams . \\n',\n",

       " b'in my review of \" the spy who shagged me , \" i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore . \\nthe cause is probably complacency ; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing . \\n \" scream 3 \" provides the latest proof of this rule . \\nin los angeles production has begun on \" stab 3 : return to woodsboro , \" the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) . \\nhowever , life soon starts imitating art , and \" stab \" cast members turn up stabbed . \\nsmelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in \" stab 3 . \" elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name . \\n . \\n . \\nuntil she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice . \\nthe late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy . \\nhe notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with . \\nindeed , \" scream 3 \" tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney\\'s mother maureen before the beginning of the original \" scream . \" \\nat the scene of each murder in \" scream 3 , \" the killer leaves a photo of sidney\\'s mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer . \\nto find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen\\'s missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films . \\n ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer\\'s relationship to sidney is ) . \\nunlike its predecessors , \" scream 3 \" doesn\\'t have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer . \\nthe characters we do suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we don\\'t even care who the killer is . \\nthe jaded detective ( patrick dempsey ) ?

       " b\"last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . \\nbased on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . \\nbut it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . \\nand co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . \\ni mean , what could possibly go wrong ? \\nthe answer is just about everything . \\nwild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . \\nthere are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . \\nbut the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . \\nat square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . \\nwill smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . \\nmy guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . \\nsmith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . \\nhe's too much of a joker . \\ni heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . \\nwhat makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . \\nthe plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . \\nthe trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . \\nloveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . \\none such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . \\nthe visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings . \\nunfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . \\nwild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . \\nmost of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . \\nif it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered . \\nkline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . \\nsalma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . \\nbranagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . \\nbut even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top . \\nrarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . \\ni suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint . \\nwild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . \\nbut it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . \\nperhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie . \\nafter such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume . \\n\",\n",

       " b'with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general . \\nhollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story . . . \\nand good characters . . . \\nand good acting , etc ( contact being the exception ) . \\nand for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth . \\nthe closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created . \\nnow comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet . \\nthe difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening . \\nmost of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering . \\nusing this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills . \\nunfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office . \\nsince seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca . \\nlately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca . \\nmost people don\\'t even realize that it is a film . \\ndespite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it . \\nniccol\\'s film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic . \\ngattaca begins in the 21st century . \\nprocreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it . \\nnatural child birth is considered old-fashioned . \\nwe are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program . \\none of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman . \\nthe only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman . \\nvincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love . \\nhowever , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99% chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span . \\nas a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics . \\nanton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws , and the competition between brothers spawns . \\nvincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan , the 14th moon of saturn , but because of his condition , gattaca , and society in general , forces him to do menial labor around the company . \\nlabeled an \" in-valid , \" vincent\\'s dream seems impossible , until he meets a black-market dna specialist , german ( tony shalhoub ) . \\ngerman introduces him to a \" valid \" who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident . \\njerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine , blood , skin and hair samples , etc . ) that he will need to get past gattaca\\'s tight security . \\nin exchange , vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship . \\nafter the murder , however , his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent\\'s eyelashes left at the scene of the crime . \\nirene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed \" valid \" working for gattaca , and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome . \\ngattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time . \\nonly two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them . \\nunfortunately , whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects-laden films , it normally gets buried . \\nthe second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs . \\nthe orange glow of gattaca\\'s scenes are impressive , but the sets deserve most of the credit . \\nthe sets are very well done , creating a futuristic sense , but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers . \\nas we look at the designs , we realize that these buildings aren\\'t too far into the future . \\nthis brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day . \\nthe best thing , however , is the plot . \\nthe story is more than your average sci-fi/thriller . \\nat its heart , it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present . \\nperhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring . \\nwould our society become a bunch of soulless zombies ? \\nmaybe human nature is a result of mankind\\'s flaws . \\nif we get rid of flaws , do we get rid of dreams as well ? \\nniccol\\'s intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well , and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story , or vice versa . \\nthe power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters . \\nwhile flat may sound like a poor job on niccol\\'s part , it actually enhances the meaning behind the story . \\nethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor , giving his best performance of his lifetime so far . \\nhis curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and \" valid \" peers . \\numa thurman is . . . well , uma thurman . \\nher character is slightly underdeveloped , but the story isn\\'t about her . \\nhowever , thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character . \\njude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character . \\nhe provides several nice touches , and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one . \\nloren dean gives a nice performance in his well-developed character . \\ndean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie . \\nalan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank . \\nstill , he does a good job . \\ngore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles , and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film . \\ngattaca is rated pg-13 for brief violent images , language , some sexuality , and nudity . \\ndespite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film , i wasn\\'t exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty . \\nit turned me off slightly , but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have . \\nif this had been a typical hollywood film , it would have ended much differently . \\nhowever , with all the mindless science fiction films out there , it is nice to have a film which doesn\\'t talk down to its audience ( i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding : g , t , c , and a ) . \\ninstead , it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want : a science fiction film with morals behind it . \\nwhatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining ?

' \\nthe elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught . \\nhe has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune . \\nalways the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail . \\nthis involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis . \\nwhen he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke . \\nnow a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home . \\ncarol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him . \\nshe's a very bright person with a good heart . \\nyet , her life is a miserable waste of time . \\nthe most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars . \\nher days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics . \\nworse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) . \\nthey became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom . \\nto her , this made sense long ago . \\nbut now , it's a different story . \\nwayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put . \\nwayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman . \\ncarol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life . \\nhowever , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change . \\nthe medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke . \\ncarol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all . \\nmaybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away . \\nthe opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . ' \\nand what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ? \\nperhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses . \\nif that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below . \\nwhen he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining . \\ncarol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness . \\nshe is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy . \\nthis , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation . \\nhenry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car . \\nhenry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash . \\nmeanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life . \\nwayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless . \\nhowever , his lack of commitment threatens their success . \\nthe heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong . \\n`where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist . \\nnewman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff . \\nhe possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive . \\nfiorentino is also a fun presence . \\nyou root for her despite her sense of amorality . \\nsure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic . \\nwith two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is . \\n\",\n",

\" \\nanymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit . \\nthis picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy . \\nthe blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry . \\nhorror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid . \\nthere are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) . \\ni also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler . \\nhe has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking . \\nthe acting is largely a waste of talent . \\nmarsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) . \\nbruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted . \\nstahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction isn\\'t good enough to hone in on their skills ( stahl\\'s performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) . \\nnone of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn\\'t all that cool . \\ndisturbing behavior is a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began . \\ni\\'m surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office . \\nit\\'s not boring , or even blatantly awful , but it\\'s an uninspired lump of a film . \\nit sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable . \\nso , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends . \\n',\n",

       " b'weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg\\'s reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches . \\nthere ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics . \\nspielberg\\'s greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story . \\nbut for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken . \\nin this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films . \\n_saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a \" pr mission \" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day . \\nryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers . \\nthe search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france . \\nthere\\'s no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie . \\nthe equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done . \\nthe opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat . \\nanother pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg\\'s brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops . \\nthe technical side of the film is peerless , as always . \\nthe camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw . \\nhanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel . \\nyet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events . \\nit has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince . \\nthroughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) . \\nfor example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground . \\nhere and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there\\'s an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man . \\nbut the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact . \\nthere are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) . \\nthe relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film . \\nultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war . \\nrather than saying _saving private ryan_ is \" realistic , \" it would be better to describe it as \" having realistic moments . \" \\nanother aspect of the \" hollywoodization \" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing . \\nanyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell\\'s superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup . \\n \" who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? \" \\nasks one infantrymen in the group of eight . \\nrendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as \" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? \" \\nor some variant thereof . \\nconversations should have been literally sprinkled with the \" f \" word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex . \\nthis is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an \" r \" rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film . \\nhowever , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic . \\nthe most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg . \\nhe cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it . \\nas if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler\\'s list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler\\'s monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller\\'s last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain . \\nthat particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film . \\nnowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) . \\nbecause of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows . \\n . \\n',\n",

       " b'i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie . \\nusing their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . \\nthis is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . \\nnow , before i continue to ferociously attack what\\'s wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . \\ncatherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) . \\nif you\\'ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don\\'t have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes . \\nthe problem we come to is that we\\'ve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn\\'t break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre . \\nthe result is that the entire production feels contrived . \\ni\\'m going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones . \\nnow while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn\\'t for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are . \\njust about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between \" entrapment \" and \" blackmail \" . \\nwith an eighty million dollar budget , you\\'d think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x . \\nwell , you\\'d be wrong . \\nthe action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular . \\nunfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years . \\nthe reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what\\'s going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists . \\nmany scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing . \\none particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . \\nnothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn\\'t she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? \\ni\\'ll tell you why : because it\\'s a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones\\' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . \\nving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . \\none last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he\\'ll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion . \\ni can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself \" it\\'ll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? \" \\nwe know jon , it\\'s called editing . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" living out loud , \" is the type of motion picture we don\\'t often see : it is a film about mature , intelligent adults , instead of the usual american film , in which children basically dress up in grown-up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven-year-olds . \\njudith ( holly hunter ) , a fortysomething living in new york city , has been having a difficult time with life lately . \\nshe is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband ( martin donovan ) , who had been cheating on her . \\nshe cannot sleep , haunted by terrible memories , often imagines off-the-wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place , and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers , liz bailey ( queen latifah ) , perform at a local club . \\njudith\\'s life does start to brighten a little when , one night when she gets home to her apartment late , strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator , pat ( danny devito ) , a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently . \\nboth of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other , seeking comfort with the other person , but while pat starts to form a deep love for her , judith only wants to remain friends . \\n \" living out loud , \" which was written by richard lagravenese ( \" the bridges of madison county \" ) , who is also making his directing debut here , is a wonderful film from beginning to end , one that is honest , genuinely funny , and poignant . \\nthe three central characters , that of judith , pat , and liz , are all written to be free-thinking , complex human beings , and are all likable , but flawed , people who are constantly interesting , as is the film itself . \\none highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen . \\nsometimes it results in comedy , and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching . \\none sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself , reading a novel . \\nan older woman comes over to her , mentions that that is a great book she is reading , and then goes over to join her own friends . \\nas the woman sits down , she looks over to see judith by herself , and motions for her to come join them . \\ninstantly , we realize this was simply in judith\\'s mind , as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends . \\nholly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here . \\nhunter , of course , was brilliant in 1993\\'s \" the piano , \" for which she won an academy award , but in this film she is even better , i think . \\nshe finds the right note for each scene and holds it . \\nand devito has never had such a humanistic role before , which i was surprised about . \\nusually he is used as the butt of a joke , or as a caricature , but in this film , has a living-and-breathing , sympathetic person to play . \\ntopping it all off is latifah , also a singer , who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself , and has a juicy , natural supporting role as , in some ways , judith\\'s role model . \\nanother joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived , \" happy \" ending , but , in staying with its realistic tone , manages to be upbeat , but truthful . \\nthe last shot is an especially powerful image . \\nnothing is said , but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all . \\nthe relationship that results between judith and pat is true-to-life and sincere . \\nas we watch these two people talk , and get to know each other , all that we wish for them both is to be happy , even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved . \\nand as , \" living out loud , \" which is one of the best films of the year , proves , sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for . \\n',\n",

       " b'first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series . \\ni have nothing against it particularly , i just don\\'t happen to watch it . \\nhaving said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well . \\nfor us non-fans , there\\'s nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things . \\nthe movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c . \\ntwo proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside . \\nthe alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien . \\nthe movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze . \\nwe then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail . \\na caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas . \\non a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn\\'t you know it , he turns out to be right . \\nthe fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse . \\nfive people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head . \\nthe two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made . \\ntheir search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to \" the truth . \" \\nthe plot , and \" the truth , \" are uninspired . \\ni got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me . \\nit didn\\'t . \\nthe possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them . \\nbut the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden . \\nit\\'s a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that \" truth \" too high . \\nif this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring . \\nbut there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it . \\nthe pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest . \\nbefore the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth . \\nthe locations are not all computer-generated sets , either . \\nthere are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . ) \\nmake this fantastic film feel more real . \\nward russell\\'s cinematography is very good . \\nthe overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film\\'s plot . \\nrussell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding . \\nwhen the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed . \\nfinally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train . \\ni don\\'t know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great . \\nthe movie\\'s soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film . ( skip \\nto the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound . \\nin one of the movie\\'s most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees . \\nthe visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound . \\nthere was no question as to who the movie\\'s stars would be . \\neven so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination . \\nboth are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy . \\nthere is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship . \\nthey are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street . \\nthere might be some romantic interest , but for now they\\'re more interested in their environs than they are in each other . \\nno single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular . \\nbut enough things were done right that the x-files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along . \\n',\n",
       " b'it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds . \\nthis leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks\\' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre\\'s toilet paper . \\nfrom this opening moment , one can infer shrek\\'s defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney-esque fairy tale . \\nalthough rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye . \\nwhile shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community . \\nthe jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world . \\nthe pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way . \\ntheir friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone . \\nshrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey . \\ncourage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey\\'s immeasurable cowardice reveals itself . \\nwhether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self-acknowledgment . \\nbut the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire-breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage . \\nhe wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them . \\nsecondly , upon shrek\\'s and donkey\\'s redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor . \\nthroughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona . \\nan ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona . \\nchildren can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his/her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist . \\nafter the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance . \\nsurprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night . \\nin this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one\\'s self . \\nupon fiona\\'s learning of shrek\\'s desire to pursue a relationship with her , fiona , knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work , gives in to her inner demons of self-ridicule and hatred . \\nany child can pull from fiona\\'s transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self-acceptance . \\non the technical side , shrek triumphs . \\ndirectors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner , evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters . \\nthese central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) , eddie murphy ( donkey ) , and cameron diaz ( princess fiona ) . \\nmyers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other , \" normal \" beings . \\nmurphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high-strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen . \\ncameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona , giving the princess/ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack . \\nwhile the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek , the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay , written by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , and roger s . h . \\nschulman . \\nthe script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer , combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike . \\ncapping it off with a constant tongue-in-cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features , the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers . \\nwith shrek , dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one-upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come . \\nthe smaller children will laugh and cheer ; the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not . \\na film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own , shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages . \\n',\n",

\\nwill everyone in the town turn against the coach ? \\nwill the team win the climactic game ? \\ndo cats bathe themselves regularly ? \\nthe so-called \" hero \" in question is john moxin ( james van der beek ) , a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team , but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead-end town . \\nat least he\\'s got the right idea , since west canaan , texas is portrayed in the film as , frankly , pathetic , with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming . \\nheck , in one scene , the front page of the town\\'s newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers\\' big win the night before . \\nwhen the team\\'s star quarterback is severely injured , tearing the ligaments in his leg , john finds himself taking over as the team\\'s leader , but his few minutes of glory do not last long , as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend ( amy smart ) when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ( ali larter ) . \\nand after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second-to-last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the \" bad guy \" ) . \\nworse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john\\'s scholarship chances if the badgers don\\'t win their final game . \\nthe plotting of \" varsity blues \" is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book . \\nadmittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained . \\nthroughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983\\'s \" all the right moves . \" \\none of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were , least of all certainly not john , who , played by van der beek ( of tv\\'s \" dawson\\'s creek \" ) , is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities . \\nwhile i probably shouldn\\'t blame this on van der beek , since the inauspicious and \" by-the-numbers \" screenplay by w . peter iliff isn\\'t of any help , he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in \" all the right moves . \" \\nthe story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama . \\nthe romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don\\'t think i\\'ve seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence . \\nsmart does not allow her character to become the \" passive girlfriend , \" instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions . \\nit\\'s too bad the camera didn\\'t linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts . \\nthe adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football . \\njohn\\'s relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance . \\nhis father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john doesn\\'t want any part of that . \\nhis mother stands beside her \" big , strong husband \" and is a passive female . \\nfinally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one-dimensional . \\nsaving \" varsity blues \" from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me . \\nthe scenes of playing football were well-shot and thankfully didn\\'t overstay their welcome , as many sports films fall victim to . \\nbut leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ? \\ni seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood . \\ndo we really need another high-school sports film ? \\nno , we don\\'t , and certainly not one of this low-caliber , which felt like a cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films . \\n \" varsity blues , \" no doubt is the first one , however , to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts . \\n',\n",

       " b'based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad , victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers , heyst ( william dafoe ) and alma ( irene jacob ) , who seek refuge on heyst\\'s isolated island . \\nhowever , their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones ( sam neil ) , martin ricardo ( rufus sewell ) and their servant , pedro ( graziano marcelli ) , who have come to steal heyst\\'s rumoured plunder . \\nwhile the novel is largely complex in characterization , the film sadly transposes conrad\\'s characters into lacklustre leads , the most disappointing being heyst himself . \\nconrad\\'s heyst adheres religiously to his late father\\'s ways of detachment and isolation . \\nhis ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice . \\nthe struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe\\'s ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst . \\nwithout properly establishing the crucial details of heyst\\'s character , all that is left of conrad\\'s main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement . \\non the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe\\'s flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism . \\nin the end , we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another . \\nthe final transformation , while perceptible , lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad\\'s novel . \\nits absence in the film is unforgivable . \\nthe film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers . \\nalma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship , namely heyst\\'s underlying philosophy of detachment , which heyst himself grapples with . \\nthe struggle against heyst\\'s ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma\\'s love for him . \\njacob , fair-skinned , gentle and yet passionate , handles the role with precision , detailing nuances where possible . \\nunfortunately , she is let down by a superficial script . \\nthe couple\\'s relationship develops too hastily , leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant show-and-tell approach . \\nall we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone . \\nthis is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions . \\nthe sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe\\'s american accent ( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london ) . \\nthe other characters such as schomberg ( jean yanne ) , the owner of a hotel , and mr jones ( sam neill ) , also fall short of conrad\\'s meticulous characterization . \\nwhile schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive , mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma . \\nsam neil\\'s caricature of a slightly stout , effeminate and soft-spoken gentleman-at-large nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as \" an insolent spectre on leave from hades , endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror \" . \\npoor characterization aside , kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo , secretary to mr jones , a reckless ruffian capable of murder . \\nsewell , with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes , becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity , masterminding deceitful plans behind jones\\' back . \\nat the same time , we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans . \\ndespite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer , very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film has ended . \\nsourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have their charm , but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic , which is what victory deserves to be . \\nthe delicately inter-woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate production . \\nat the end of the film , we are told that perhaps alma\\'s victory was in teaching heyst how to love . \\na hollow victory indeed . \\nthe flying inkpot\\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\n',\n",
       " b'tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . \\nthe film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it\\'s evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . \\nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . \\nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . \\ntectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . \\nit\\'s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , \" look ! \\nart ! \" ) , \\nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . \\nbecause we\\'re constantly made aware that we\\'re watching a play or a movie , it\\'s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer\\'s ideas . \\nthey\\'re not real , sympathetic , or believable . \\ni\\'m willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . \\ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . \\none day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . \\nwhile preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . \\nmeanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . \\nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . \\nhowever , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . \\nthe tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn\\'t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . \\ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . \\nthere are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren\\'t bilingual ) . \\nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it\\'s different , ( b ) it\\'s not like anything they\\'ve seen before , and ( c ) it\\'s pretentious . \\nfor everyone else , it\\'s not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . \\n',\n",

       " b'these days , we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old , cult tv shows . \\nmost of the times , the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past . \\nbut , some five or six years ago , there weren\\'t that many movies and the trend didn\\'t look that depressing . \\nso , the people who , like the author of this review , grew up watching flintstones , popular 1960s animated series about \" modern stone age \" family , weren\\'t particularly worried when the word came about live action remake . \\nafter all , the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and , if anything else , at least the special effects would be good . \\nthe plot revolves about flintstones , family set in fictious stone age \" town \" of bedrock , whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america . \\nfred flinstone ( john goodman ) works in the quarry , and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble ( rick moranis ) and his wife betty ( rosie o\\'donnell ) to adopt a baby . \\nto return the favour , barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred , and , based on that , fred gets well-paid job in management . \\nbut , of course , this is just a sham - corrupt official cliff vandercave ( kyle maclachlan ) and his sultry secretary sharon stone ( halle berry ) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme . \\nin the meantime , fred\\'s wife wilma ( elizabeth perkins ) must face her mother ( elizabeth taylor ) who can\\'t stand fred . \\non the superficial level , the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life . \\ncomputer effects are flawless , and the costumes , settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show . \\nunfortunately , problems with this film start with inadequate casting - rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney , while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie o\\'donnell . \\nbut the greatest problem of all is plot , or to be precise , the lack of plot . \\nsome thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame , original characters one-dimensional , and many elements of the story , like embezzlement and inter-office politics , totally incomprehensible for the little children , the main targeted audience of this film . \\nresult is almost unwatchable mess , occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting ( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma ) and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as \" high concept \" . \\nafter great hype , movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version . \\nall in all , film isn\\'t that bad , but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it . \\n',\n",

these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . \\nexcept for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . \\nthe reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . \\nwe\\'re given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them . \\nmatt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker . \\ned norton\\'s worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they\\'re worth . \\njohn turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments . \\nhe\\'s both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro\\'s low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich\\'s heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself . \\nmartin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike\\'s law professors , abe petrovsky . \\nwhile landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one\\'s self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending . \\nperhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn\\'t seem to have much presence on screen . \\nshe\\'s a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn\\'t be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon\\'s reactions instead . \\na good thing about rounders is that it doesn\\'t get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can\\'t find time for humor . \\nthe film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales . \\none game in a cigar club had me in stitches . \\n \" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , \" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other . \\ni was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys . \\nwith all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing . \\nyou might think you know a lot about poker , but think again . \\nluckily , we\\'re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what\\'s going on . \\nthe narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do . \\nit\\'s nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world . \\nas a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades . \\nwait ! \\nas a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace . \\nhang on ! \\npacked with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house . \\nokay , i guess that\\'s enough . \\noh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol\\' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein\\'s mother . \\n',\n",
       " b'steve soderbergh\\'s \" sex , lies , and videotape , \" which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989 , arguably began the resurgence of independent films . \\nmade on a shoestring budget of $1 . 2 million , with then relatively unknown actors , it is a provocative , thoroughly original drama . \\nthe film mostly focuses on the four central characters , all in their late 20\\'s-early 30\\'s . \\nann ( andie macdowell ) , an unfulfilled housewife , is married to john ( peter gallagher ) , an insensitive lawyer , who , unbeknownst to her , is having an affair with her younger sister , cynthia ( laura san giacomo ) . \\ncomplicating matters even worse is graham ( james spader , who won best actor at cannes ) , john\\'s old college buddy , who comes to stay at their house . \\nann is absolutely won over by him , even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex . \\nthat is the set-up for the last hour of the picture , and since the film is entitled , \" sex , lies , and videotape , \" it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise . \\ndirector steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker , ranging from the independent , to the mainstream ( 1998\\'s \" out of sight \" ) , to the downright kafkaesque ( 1997\\'s \" schizopolis \" ) . \\nhe is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances , and believes in the work that he does , and , \" sex , lies , and videotape , \" is probably his most confident , and maybe even best , to date . \\nthe performances are superb from all four leads , but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character . \\nshe is always a very winning actress , but this is probably her most three-dimensional role that she has had ( with a close second being altman\\'s 1993 mosaic , \" short cuts \" ) . \\nthe other parts are perfectly cast as well , from spader\\'s ominous graham , to gallagher\\'s self-involved john , to giacomo\\'s outspoken cynthia . \\nthe final act of the film , especially , comes right out of left field , and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching , and it would be criminal to give away the film\\'s secrets . \\nsuffice to say that , through one powerful sequence , ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell , and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty , as well as deception . \\nthe film has one fault , however . \\nthe characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another , and often unlikable . \\nif there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher , it probably would have helped , since his relationship with macdowell isn\\'t quite as explored as i would have liked . \\n \" sex , lies , and videotape , \" although minorly flawed , is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film . \\nsoderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it , and the final product certainly proves this . \\n',\n",

' . \\nthere are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . \\nthe story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . \\neven so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . \\ndirector paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' . \\nthis picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . \\nalthough on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . \\nhowever , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . \\nmy friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon . \\ni guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . \\nbe forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . \\nbe prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! \\nevent horizon is highly recommended ? ? but at your own risk ! \\nit has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one . \\n\",\n",

       " b'i\\'m an avid fan of the \" alien \" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) . \\nof course , that doesn\\'t mean that i\\'m gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because \" alien : resurrection , \" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were . \\nhowever , it\\'s a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series . \\nin short , i had a good time . \\n \" alien : resurrection \" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre\\'s answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one . \\nof course , the last one wasn\\'t very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn\\'t financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) . \\nso back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that\\'s a bad thing , but it\\'s becoming a cliche ) . \\nso she\\'s cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called \" the auriga \" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her . \\nonce you get past the fact that you can\\'t figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film\\'s okay . \\nalso on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won\\'t state it , but unless you\\'ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it\\'s nicely covered up ) . \\nthere\\'s a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it\\'s never really deepened enough . \\noh well . \\nwell , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship . \\nand it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who\\'s death is comical yet sad since , well , he\\'s dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth . \\nof course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old \" alien \" -brand fun . \\nthe real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there\\'s always a bit of it , most notably in \" aliens \" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) . \\nwhat\\'s interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach . \\n \" alien \" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights . \\n \" aliens \" is a wild , tense thriller . \\n \" alien 3 \" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir . \\n \" alien 4 \" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares . \\njean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like \" das boot \" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat . \\nthe chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there\\'s the most tense surgery scene since \" face/off \" towards the beginning ) . \\nand not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that . \\nthis all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others . \\nthere are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed . \\none is the aforementioned surgery scene . \\nanother one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome . \\nthe underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet\\'s earlier film , \" delicatessen \" ) . \\nand the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to \" goldfinger \" ) . \\nbut the best scene in the entire film ( i\\'m sure i\\'m not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an \" 8 \" tatooed on her arm ) . \\nit might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga . \\nthe screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters . \\nhowever , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there\\'s very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared . \\nand , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : \" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! \" \\njohner : \" well , i can get you off . \\nbut not this ship . \" ) \\nthe acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in \" se7en \" who performed the \" lust \" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him . \\nwinona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . \\nof course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show . \\nplaying a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . \\nshe\\'s not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for \" aliens , \" but she\\'s just awesome . \\noverall , it\\'s a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn\\'t really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment . \\nthe style is the best part of the film , which isn\\'t really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . \\nbut it\\'s entertaining as hell , and it\\'s definitely fit for the \" alien \" series . \\n',\n",

       " b'in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well . \\ntaken as a whole , there\\'s little that\\'s special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us . \\nbut it\\'s intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted . \\nso , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it\\'s a worthwhile sample of entertainment . \\nlike scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man . \\nthe formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different . \\nal pacino\\'s slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams\\' sean mcguire is much more subtle . \\nand matt damon\\'s will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o\\'donnell\\'s charlie . \\nwill is a troubled individual . \\nas a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse . \\nan orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis . \\nnow , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet . \\nhe has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box . \\nbut he\\'s a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems . \\nwhile working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building\\'s hall blackboards . \\nthen , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work . \\nwill flees , but lambeau tracks him down . \\nunfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer . \\nthe judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist . \\neventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case . \\nafter a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor . \\nand , as will advances his self-awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co-ed named skylar ( minnie driver ) . \\nthe script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation . \\nthe characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles . \\nat one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a \" taster\\'s choice moment . \" \\nlater , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith . \\n ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it\\'s not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . ) \\ndirector gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes . \\nthere\\'s an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric . \\nlikewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie\\'s friendship . \\nmany of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic . \\nmatt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will . \\nminnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it\\'s refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) . \\nthe outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber . \\narguably the best dramatic work in the actor\\'s career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams\\' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination . \\nadequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) . \\nlike most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . \\nbut meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren\\'t always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail . \\ngood will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the \" good \" in the title . \\n',\n",

--the \\nman of today ? -- \" i \\ndon\\'t know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn\\'t know either the way out or the way in \" --so sighs the man of today . . . . \\nthis is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay . \\nthis tolerance and largeur of the heart that \" forgives \" everything because it \" understands \" everything is a sirocco to us . \\nrather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds ! \\nas far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say . \\nits alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure . \\nfor example wayne gayle\\'s first report ends with some gen x dude saying , \" if i were a mass murderer i\\'d be mickey and mallory , \" in his most excellent bill and ted voice . \\non one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes . \\nit seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he\\'d be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it . \\nlet me exemplify what i\\'ve been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her \" the worst fuckin\\' head i\\'ve ever had in my life ! ! ! \" \\nnow , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn\\'t , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this . \\nsometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever . \\nit\\'s no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey . \\nas the attendant approached he took on mickey\\'s character in the eyes of mallory . \\nshe needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory . \\nupon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else . \\nthe style of the movie is a whole \\'nother matter that i won\\'t get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power . \\nlet me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle . \\nthe rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood . \\nalso , jungian archetypes abound . \\nthese can\\'t help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames . \\nsome of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) : \\nmickey to mallory : \" one of these days i\\'m gonna be cummin\\' for you , \" in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off . \\nsemen is a symbol for great potential and things to come . \\nat the time they haven\\'t yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet . \\nthe two of course go hand in hand . \\nfor an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs . \\nmickey during his marriage to mallory : \" as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife . \" \\nthe way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too . \\nit reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones . \\nthis is what mickey means by \" creator of my universe , \" he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes . \\nit is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears . \\nscagnetti\\'s first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant\\'s mouth . \\nthe indian sage releasing mallory\\'s father , who was reincarnated as a snake : \" old man , go be a snake , \" after telling his \" snake story \" that ends with \" bitch , you knew i was a snake . \" \\nafter mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , \" you killed life ! ! ! \" \\nthis is another telling quote because it implies they didn\\'t see themselves as killers of life . \\nthen what were they killing up to that time ? \\nin some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were . \\nin other cases , all the anti-life forces , the cops and their parents . \\nthe butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison . \\nit of course symbolizes rebirth . \\ndr . emil reingold , as portrayed by steven wright , passing judgement on m&m : \" mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong , they just don\\'t give a damn . \" \\nthis is reminiscent of nietzsche\\'s whole philosophy , and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil . \\nmickey : \" the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers . \" \\nmickey ( again in his interview ) : \" me and you , we are not the same species . \" \\nnotice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control . \\nmickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang . \\nthe wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader , no matter who it is . \\nmickey : how ya feelin\\' ? \\nwayne : fucking great ! \\nmickey : you got the feelin\\' ? \\nwayne : i\\'m alive . \\ni\\'m alive for the first fuckin\\' time ! \\nwhat an incredible transformation this is . \\nhe got the feeling and he couldn\\'t contain himself . \\nwhat a feeling . \\nthat feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe . \\nmickey when almost caught in a dead end , \" think , think , think , think . \" \\ngo figure it out . \\ndwight ( tommy lee jones ) in general , because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film . \\nhis whole attitude can be summed up with , \" destroy them ! ! ! \" \\n',\n",

       " b'it\\'s been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it\\'s been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly . \\ni\\'d saw that it\\'s been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i\\'m hardly comparing \" a simple plan \" to , say , \" rear window \" or \" strangers on a train . \" \\nyet it\\'s almost as good . \\nit\\'s simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral . \\nelegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , \" a simple plan \" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) . \\nwithout anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don\\'t flaunt anything they don\\'t want to flaunt , they\\'ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton . \\nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves . \\n \" a simple plan , \" though borrows a little from each of these . \\na little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here . \\nbut , as austin powers would say , that\\'s not necessarily its bag ( baby ) . \\nwhat i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it\\'s successfully able to have its cake and eat it too . \\nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag . \\nso while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity . \\nin one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn\\'t look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide ) . \\ninstead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton\\'s face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion . \\nthere\\'s a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he\\'s committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching . \\nin short , probably the best piece of direction raimi\\'s ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch \" persona \" \\'s \" sex scene \" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman\\'s ever done ) . \\nbut the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof . \\nyet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story . \\nwhen the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights . \\nthere\\'s at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don\\'t come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror . \\nduring the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra \" they can\\'t do this , can they ? \" \\nstreeming through my head . \\nin fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen\\'s [superior , but forget about it] \" fargo , \" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then \\nagain , after seeing the \" evil dead \" films , i\\'d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed \" raimi \" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) . \\ninstead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches . \\nmost particularly , billy bob thornton\\'s character , jacob , is a brilliant creation . \\nhis dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there\\'s authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we\\'re not totally laughing at him . \\nthe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real . \\njacob\\'s a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . \\nthe final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . \\ni particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . \\nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he\\'s ever given and further proof that he\\'s the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don\\'t believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in \" primary colors , \" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn\\'t been in the same year ) because he\\'s easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . \\nhe brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it\\'s difficult picturing anyone else in the role . \\nthe rest of the cast is great too , from paxton\\'s declining working man to chelcie ross\\' amiable town sheriff . \\neven fonda shows off her talents nicely . \\nand if i had any complaints about the film , it\\'s that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . \\nand the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you\\'re trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn\\'t raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . \\nand , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . \\ni won\\'t reveal it , but it\\'s way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn\\'t already too much of that anyway . \\nfor a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . \\nimagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it\\'s like if in \" crime and punishment \" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i\\'m at all comparing \" a simple plan \" to dostoevsky . \\nthe ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . \\nbut despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i\\'ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . \\nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece . \\n',\n",
       " b'the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made . \\ni know that is very sweeping statement , so i\\'ll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of \" science fiction , \" stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot . \\n2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science . \\nmost all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting . \\nthe andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high-tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town . \\nsomething bad happens to them . \\npictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight . \\napparently everyone in the town is dead . \\nthe authorities call a \" wildfire alert , \" summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super-secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada . \\ntwo of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins . \\nsome went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive . \\nthey take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a \" directive 712 , \" an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb . \\nwhat they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth-like life and mutates as it grows . \\ntheir only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict . \\nwhat they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a-bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet . \\nthey barely call off the bombing in time . \\nbut then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out . \\nthis triggers the lab\\'s last-ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb . \\nto those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow . \\nmuch of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts . \\nbut what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw . \\nthe performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low-key and restrained , just like scientists . \\nto me , the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting . \\nwe follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step , puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we don\\'t expect . \\nthis film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it . \\nit was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating , mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body\\'s wrist is slashed , spilling its powdered blood . \\n',\n",

       " b'jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today . \\nfrom time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances . \\non the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis\\' king kong . \\nand , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality . \\nhush is one such example . \\nlange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn\\'t such a prime example of motion picture tedium . \\nthe film opens , as many so-called \" psychological thrillers \" do , by posing as a light drama . \\nwe are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks\\' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love . \\njackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) . \\nthe moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs . \\nsoon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) . \\nonce that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives . \\nas long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it\\'s a declaration of war . \\nhush has three very simple problems : it\\'s incredibly dumb , it\\'s incredibly boring , and it\\'s incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) . \\nthis film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow\\'s bare buttocks . \\nfrankly , it\\'s embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange\\'s stature give a performance like this -- it\\'s like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) . \\nmeanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object . \\nas in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn . \\nhere , it\\'s mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle . \\nof course , since schaech\\'s character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it\\'s impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation . \\nmaybe someone should ask him if he\\'s familiar with oedipus . \\nmartha is , of course , the evil one . \\nhow do we know she\\'s evil ? \\nshe smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work . \\non the other hand , helen is a good girl . \\nthe evidence for this is that she\\'s nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents . \\nthat\\'s about it for character development . \\nbeyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists . \\nhowever , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying . \\ni can\\'t imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion . \\neither there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script . \\nbefore the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it . \\nviewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is . \\ncheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable . \\nmost entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren\\'t especially good . \\nfilms like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along . \\nin general , however , they\\'re directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension . \\nthat\\'s not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care . \\nindeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid . \\n',\n",

       " b'virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre . \\nsince \\'dark city\\' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another . \\nthe most popular and original of them all has been the matrix . \\nall the films released after it , have been less successful . \\ndavid cronenberg\\'s existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone . \\nand when \\'the thirteenth floor\\' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored . \\ni admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again . \\nit was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to \\'the thirteenth floor\\' . \\nhowever , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak\\'s latest picture . \\nmatrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood\\'s action and effects with an intelligent story . \\nexistenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness . \\n\\'the thirteenth floor\\' is somewhere in between . \\ninstead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , \\'the thirteenth floor\\' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding . \\nin a near future . . . on \\nthe thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real . \\nright after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered . \\ndouglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth . \\na beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence . \\nthe first \" download into simulation \" is impressive . \\nit is the creator\\'s first visit to his world , his creation . \\nin order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone\\'s identity , become another person . \\nthis is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people \" wake up \" in unknown places and strange things start happen . \\nthey start to doubt in their own sanity . \\nthese innocent people pay for the mistakes of their \" users \" and creators with their sanity and their lives . \\nit is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone\\'s fantasy . \\nwith an appealing ( \" blade runner \" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present . \\nour modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal . \\nthe thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile . \\nthis contrast demonstrates a wish for change . \\nvirtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities . \\nto some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences . \\nfor others - a way to start over and \" correct \" their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past . \\nvirtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life . \\nat least that\\'s how it is all beginning . \\nbut when you\\'re waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise . \\nthis , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness . \\nsome important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ? \\nwhat is thought ? \\nwho are we ? \\nif these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made . \\nthey are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner . \\nthe visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes . \\nkirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties . \\nthere are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose\\'s moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time . \\na rather unusual thing about\\'the thirteenth floor\\' is the almost complete lack of special effects . \\nthere are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion . \\nthis is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking . \\nthis is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and \\'dark city\\'-fans will be pleased . \\nthis film is interesting and inspiring . \\nit has everything existenz doesn\\'t , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix . \\nand then there is a happy end which , like in \\'dark city\\' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context . \\nthe plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and \\'dark city\\' . \\nwith this in mind , \\'the thirteenth floor\\' doesn\\'t make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality . \\n',\n",

       " b'synopsis : al simmons , top-notch assasin with a guilty conscience , dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell . \\nmaking a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell\\'s army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape . \\nsullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn\\'s attention . \\ncomments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the \" spider-man \" titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn . \\nmcfarlane\\'s \" spawn \" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s . \\nmcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max . \\nthe early \" spawn \" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane\\'s genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing . \\nwith the popularity of \" spawn \" and the success of the current warner bros . \\'s batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn . \\nin the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series . \\nthis topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark . \\nwhat happened ? \\nwhy is spawn so bad ? \\ntodd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo . \\ni don\\'t think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film . \\ni place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology . \\nthese films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc . spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics . \\nhardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons . \\na lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don\\'t get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren\\'t engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath ) . \\nspawn\\'s translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level . \\nmcfarlane\\'s spawn was a tortured hero . \\na mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda . \\nhaving died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda . \\nsimmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married . \\ndespite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn\\'t help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld . \\nspawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so . \\nwhen the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching . \\nthe cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters . \\nspawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman ) . \\njohn leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second . \\ni ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator . \\nthe film , however , spends so much time on the violator\\'s offensive antics that they grate on the nerves . \\napparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator\\'s lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave . \\nleguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film . \\nmichael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on . \\nmore time needed to be spent on white\\'s character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings . \\na special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn . \\neasily the hammiest performance in the movie , it\\'s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now . \\nsheen\\'s excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film . \\nmany other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down . \\nmtv-style , jerky , in-your-face editing is one of them . \\nflames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting . \\ncogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film . \\nhe goofily tells the audience , at one point , that \" how much of [spawn\\'s] humanity is left remains to be seen , \" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another . \\nthe music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue . \\nloud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes . \\nto be fair , however , marilyn manson\\'s \" long hard road out of hell \" effectively compliments spawn\\'s return to earth , while filter and the crystal method\\'s \" ( can\\'t you ) trip like i do \" proves a surprisingly fitting theme song . \\nfor as good a comic book as it is , \" spawn \" did not spawn a good movie . \\nspawn , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little plot and character development . \\nit receives two stars for its technically well-done special effects . \\nmany other films , though , have equal , if not superior , special effects and are much better . \\nrated pg-13 , spawn seems more violent than many r-rated movies and probably wouldn\\'t be appropriate for the very young . \\n',\n",

       " b'seen september 13 , 1998 at 4 p . m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater #2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic\\'s pass . \\n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] \\n \" rounders \" is exactly the kind of movie parents don\\'t want their kids to see . \\nit\\'s not that it\\'s a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it\\'s a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling . \\nand to take make things \" worse \" it proves this through its original , fascinating story . \\nthere have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the \" noir \" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life . \\nthis film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing . \\nmatt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played . \\ndamon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . \\nmike\\'s about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer . \\nbut then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . \\ndamon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . \\nhe never sounds like he\\'s reading from a script , nor that he\\'s trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . \\nthe screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys\\' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . \\nimmediately we get the sense that poker isn\\'t for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel . \\nthe game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . \\nthe gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . \\nthe film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . \\nit concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . \\nwe learn only a little about mike , both past and present . \\npresently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . \\nthey go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike\\'s childhood pal and fellow rounder \" worm \" ( norton ) is released from prison . \\nit\\'s not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . \\ntechnically , the plot isn\\'t unlike many children\\'s sitcoms in which the \" good \" kid\\'s \" bad \" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . \\nwhat this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . \\nmike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . \\nwhere as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he\\'s dealt and works with them . \\nsometimes they pay off ( i . e . \\nhis ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don\\'t ( i . e . \\nthe fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) . \\nonce things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . \\nmike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites\\' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . \\neverything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything\\'s a battle against the cards destiny deals . \\none scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . \\nmatt\\'s good at gambling but he\\'s also got potential to be a great lawyer . \\nhe could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there\\'s stability but not much risk involved . \\ncan someone who\\'s gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? \\nif the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test . \\neverything is told from mike\\'s perspective , but we\\'re finally able to recognize some things on our own . \\nthis makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that . \\nit works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof . \\nwhat separates \" rounders \" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" knock off \" is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie . \\nit\\'s also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year . \\ni figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found . \\njean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods . \\nrob schneider plays van damme\\'s partner , and rochon plays . . . \\nactually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be . \\nshe just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there . \\nmany things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick . \\nwhere chan comes off as endearing in his \" normal guy \" character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp . \\nwe\\'re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions . \\nto be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear . \\nthe film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong . \\ntsui hark ( who directed van damme\\'s last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , \" double team \" ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that\\'s no exaggeration . \\nwe are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme\\'s foot entering a shoe . \\nfabulous ! \\nseriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don\\'t get carried away . \\nfor example , look at sam raimi . \\n \" army of darkness \" , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story . \\nthat\\'s a concept that tsui can\\'t seem to grasp . \\nthe special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * \" knock off \" to the point where the audience doesn\\'t have a clue as to what\\'s happening any more . \\nanother problem with the film is that it looks cheap . \\nthe film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night . \\nand for some inexplicable reason , everyone\\'s voice seems to have been dubbed . \\neven the stars . \\nand even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent . \\nfor example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window . \\nthe car slams into the ground , and the left wheel is completely destroyed . \\nseconds later , the car drives off at full speed . \\nhey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere . \\nfinally , the acting . \\nnobody gives a good performance in this film . \\nvan damme , an actor i usually like , is way off the mark playing \" everyman \" . \\nand schneider , here to provide comic relief i assume , is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene . \\neven the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over-the-top performance as . . . \\nonce again , i have no idea who he was supposed to be . \\nin case i haven\\'t yet made it clear enough , \" knock off \" is the worst movie of van damme\\'s career and possibly the worst movie of the decade . \\nand it\\'s not even one of those movies that\\'s so bad it\\'s funny . \\nit\\'s too inept to be funny . \\nthere are no redeeming factors in \" knock off \" and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased . \\n',\n",

\\noh , that\\'s right . \\n\\'i\\'m sorry , but your time is up ! \\' \" \\nthis is what passes for humor in the film . \\nthe audience doesn\\'t necessarily laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience can\\'t believe they\\'re watching this crap -- although watching it they are ) . \\nnick mancuso\\'s chainsmoking , nervous-wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler\\'s character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief . \\nin between drags off his cigarette , for instance , in one of the movie\\'s best scenes , david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex-wife is . \\nin exaggerated exasperation , he nearly shouts \" the woman is a cuckoo-bird ! \" \\n ( trust me , it is funny in context . ) \\nand so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion . \\ni won\\'t reveal the ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review ) , but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film . \\nmolly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds ! \\nmolly , at one point in the film , not-so-brilliantly observes , after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family\\'s to spy upon them , that \" she\\'s crazy . \" \\nyou\\'d be pretty crazy too if you\\'d rented this turkey . \\ni\\'d avoid it unless it\\'s on tv and you come across it . \\nif you do , you may want to watch it , groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot , and feel good that you didn\\'t spend money renting it . \\n',\n",
       " b'by now i figured i\\'d seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half-dozen times -- not that i\\'m complaining . \\nto call him the \" master of suspense \" is an understatement . \\nthe paradine case ( 1947 ) , admittedly one of hitchcock\\'s lesser movies , turned out to be one i\\'d missed . \\nthis one , like all hitchcock films , is well worth savoring . \\nthe story opens with the rich mrs . maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband . \\nas mrs . paradine , alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world . \\nto franz waxman\\'s stark and moody music , we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels . \\nstripped of her fine raiment , she becomes a commoner again , which , as it turns out , was what she was before she met her husband . \\n \" a brief skirmish , and you\\'ll be lunching at the savoy again , \" anthony keane , her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting , predicting a fast and easy trial . \\ngregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister . \\n \" she\\'s no murderess , \" he argues simplistically , smitten by her beauty . \\n \" she\\'s too fine a woman . \" \\nhis attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife , gay ( ann todd ) . \\nunlike most hitchcock movies , which are centered on the thriller and the mystery , this one is more a romantic melodrama . \\ntypical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light . \\nshe deflects her husband\\'s affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client . \\nthe dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs . paradine\\'s portrait nearby . \\nin the relatively unsatisfying first half , little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires . \\nto the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs . paradine acquitted because , if mrs . paradine dies , his heart will go with her . \\nif she is freed , he will be able to forget her . \\nas part of the soap opera , a mysterious louis jordan plays mr . paradine\\'s valet , who has had some not to be discussed relationships . \\ncharles coburn plays anthony\\'s legal partner , sir simon flaquer . \\nand charles laughton , who looks like coburn , is judge lord horfield . \\nthis being proper british society , they will all dine together at the judge\\'s house not long before the case begins . \\ncourt tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences , some subtle and others not , between the american and the british judicial systems . \\none , for example , of which i was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak to his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying . \\none sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations . \\nas the judge\\'s wife , lady sophie horfield , ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress -- the film\\'s only nomination -- for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit . \\n ( so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walk-on ? \\nat 37 minutes into the film , he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case . \\ndon\\'t miss it . ) \\nin the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom . \\nthe great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first . \\nwatch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trial\\'s action . \\nas anthony explains it , the simple case has only 3 possibilities : mr . paradine poisoned himself , mrs . paradine did it , or the valet did it . \\nthe end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid . \\nthe paradine case runs 1 : 53 . \\nthe picture is in black and white . \\nit is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested . \\n',\n",
       " b\"a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature , beams itself onto a russian science vessel . \\nwell , this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller . \\nanyhow , this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus' known as man . \\nthe original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated , and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it . \\nno more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies , the movie is that predictable . \\nthe story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist . \\nthe captain of the tug , played by donald sutherland , makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age ( looks to be in his 60's ) . \\nto add to this we're shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields , and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks . \\nsome of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific , in a typhoon no less . \\nnone of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control . \\nthis makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story , a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable . \\nall the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects . \\nthe waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves . \\nit looks genuinely fake , granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish . \\nalso on the topic of flaws , the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly , why ? \\nif this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics , should it not be able to create them move faster ? \\nregardless , the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it . \\nas to the actual casting for the movie , finally there is nothing to complain about . \\nthe actors were superb , but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles . \\nhaving the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe . \\nwatching these actors act this story out made it bearable , if barely . \\nthe one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening . \\nso if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci-fi thriller then you won't be too disappointed . \\nas the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens , it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect . \\nthis movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv . \\n\",\n",

       " b'i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival . \\n\\'holocaust comedy receives standing ovation\\' , the headlines read . \\nintrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years . \\neven though the movie was extremely well-received by critics and public alike , i couldn\\'t help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated . \\nonly now do i see the error of my ways . \\nafter finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a \" holocaust comedy \" ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps . \\nrather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation . \\nroberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse ) . \\nthrough the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this \" beautiful princess \" , as he calls her . \\nemploying the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini ) . \\nlife treats them well until hitler\\'s minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son\\'s innocence no matter what the sacrifice . \\ngranted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a \" hogan\\'s heros \" and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews . \\nsomehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it\\'s gravely serious subject . \\nso , we\\'ve established that life is beautiful is not a \" holocaust comedy \" . \\nbut , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me . \\nthe film , despite critic\\'s declarations of it being a \" triumph of the human spirit \" , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway . \\nsome have called the story an \" affirmation of the beauty of life \" , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man\\'s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy . \\nthe film\\'s ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting . \\nessentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film . \\nhowever , i am not denying the movie\\'s greatness . \\nbelieve me , it\\'s fantastic . \\ni\\'m just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as . \\nbut perhaps i\\'m reading more into the movie than is really there . \\nmaybe the film\\'s brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit . \\nin fact , maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it . \\n',\n",

       " b'reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . \\nthe guy can\\'t seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : \" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel \" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . \\nhis screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . \\ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , \" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! \" \\nit\\'s almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . \\nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? \\nauteur theory be damned ; it\\'s kruger\\'s \" style \" , not the director\\'s that winds up on screen . \\nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \" sometimes less is more \" . \\nand his numerous twists can\\'t even claim to be originals ; arlington rd\\'s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol\\' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn\\'t know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the \" character \" . . . grammar \\nbe damned ) . \\n \" how did you know that ? \" \\nthe stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . \\n . \\n . \\nsince twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger\\'s screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it\\'s no wonder why he works so frequently . \\nhe\\'s quickly becoming miramax\\'s mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . \\nthis is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . \\ntheir company\\'s current logo could be \" we ride the trends \" . \\nreindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . \\nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . \\naffleck is such a puppy dog that it\\'s impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone\\'s bitch . \\nthe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent \" serious \" movie getting . \\nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who\\'s played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) \\njames frain is nick , rudy\\'s cellmate , a manslaughterer who\\'s found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . \\nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she\\'s never seen one picture of him . \\nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley\\'s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . \\nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . \\nthough by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i\\'ve described might as well be irrelevant . \\nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . \\nincluded : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . \\nthough it\\'s an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . \\nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . \\nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau \\n ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . \\nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . \\nproblem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . \\ncharacter problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . \\nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . \\nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . \\ncharlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . \\nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . \\ngary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . \\nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience . \\n',\n",

       " b'this is a film about secrets , some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl , frances boyd ( ashley ) . \\nothers that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship , like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple , geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) , the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field , and his artist wife , lillian ( miriam healy-louie ) , who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work . \\nand , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line . \\nreceiving a summer grant to study \" chemo-electric therapy , \" geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three-year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her . \\nhe has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses . \\nhis main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don\\'t want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science . \\nthat he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming . \\nhe is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty- years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins . \\nthe third view in all this is the artist\\'s , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist\\'s work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , \" why shouldn\\'t the same be true of the scientist ? \" \\nshe argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored . \\ngeoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company\\'s higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can\\'t wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life . \\nwhile out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area . \\nin the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . \\nthe scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david\\'s view but coming at it from a much different angle . \\nit was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . \\nthat the director\\'s point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . \\nthe point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . \\ngeoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty . \\nalex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex\\'s apartment . \\ngeoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him . \\nthe relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely . \\nthe dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies . \\nthe only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david\\'s loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city . \\nthe farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist\\'s lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way . \\nwhat is progress ? \\nwhat can one expect out of life ? \\nis the small farmer about to become extinct ? \\nthe answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . \\nthat this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . \\nno telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . \\nthere is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don\\'t like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . \\nthat is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . \\nthe stakes in this ecological struggle are that high . \\nperhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . \\nit was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso\\'s guernica had for him . \\nboth artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on . \\nthe pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , \" make the world go away \" blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances\\' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science . \\nperhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ?

' \\nbecause so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ] \\nfirst of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it . \\nwe know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire . \\nwe know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . ' \\nwe also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) . \\nwhat we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth . \\nto me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity . \\nalso , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . \\nmost notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine . \\nfor those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . \\nwith `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights . \\nunfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained . \\ni didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness . \\nif you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) . \\nbut i digress . \\ni've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself . \\nall these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself . \\nwhat we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s . \\nits similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality . \\nthe basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times . \\nwe're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo . \\nwe're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly . \\nwe're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) . \\nthe two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) . \\nthe leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears . \\nhe is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series . \\nsidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person . \\nclearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers . \\ni have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) . \\nbut it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along . \\nthe film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another . \\nthere are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook . \\nthe other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting . \\nthe sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits . \\nas we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story . \\nand here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council . \\nto briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation . \\ntheir meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force . \\njinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves . \\nthis also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before . \\nin fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before . \\nthe element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary . \\nby the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot . \\nit's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence . \\nnot that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history . \\nand at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter . \\nit does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society . \\n`the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness . \\nso many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited . \\nbut this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies . \\n\",\n",

\\nthe backseat ? \\nthe next car ? \\nthrilling prospects , to be sure , but actually , ghostface is at the weary residence , waiting for cotton\\'s girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering . \\nwhat\\'s missing from this sequence , and indeed scream 3\\'s remaining frights ( most disappointingly , the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes , one of which might spring to life ) , is an elaborate and attenuated payoff . \\nour other surviving regulars have become estranged . \\nsidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks , while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2\\'s movie-within-a-movie , \" stab 3 \" , and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program . \\nmurder reunites them , as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of \" stab 3 \" , imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney\\'s death . \\nthe appeal of ghostface\\'s villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend , your classmate , your next door neighbour . . . or a combination of people . \\nscream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery , with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next , but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive . \\nironic self-reflection aside , parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there\\'s at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume . \\nwith scream 3 , the novelty of ghostface\\'s ever-mutating identity has worn off some , but the character remains conceptually potent . \\nconceptually . the execution of ghostface\\'s master plan this time around is creaky , because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we\\'d come to understand in scream and scream 2 . the movie gets in the silly habit of saying \" all bets are off ! \" \\nin reference to the \" rules \" of a trilogy\\'s third act , but there\\'s a difference between rule breaking and cheating . \\nwith the departure of kevin williamson , who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 ( that , for reasons incomprehensible to me , was ignored , save the notion of \" stab 3 \" ) , kruger needed to be reined in tighter , and by wes craven . \\ncraven\\'s direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects . \\nhow else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies ) , akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny . \\nit pains me to write this , but scream 3\\'s comedy is generally laughless , with the exception of well-timed performances by josh pais ( as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven\\'s music of the heart ) , jamie kennedy ( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 ) , and parker posey ( through sheer force of will as a b-actress ) . \\nthe visuals are much weaker in part three , as well-the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming\\'s camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before . \\n ( aside : in the wake of columbine , craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3-why the sanctimony , when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? ) \\nfinally , marco beltrami\\'s music cues the suspense too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it\\'s mostly silent . \\nsting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here , they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve-jangling score . \\ni look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe , the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii-woefully out of synch with its prequels , scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish , and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs . \\nthe film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : ? part three must disappoint\\' . \\n',\n",

       " b'every year , hollywood crowns a new \" it boy \" --a young actor pegged for major movie stardom . \\ninheriting the mantle from last year\\'s \" winner , \" matthew mcconaughey , is matt damon , and , like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face , as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham\\'s the rainmaker and good will hunting . \\ndamon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--in this case , francis ford coppola\\'s take on the rainmaker . \\ndamon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor , who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company . \\nwhile rudy\\'s ( and the film\\'s ) main concern is this case , he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role ) . \\nwritten for the screen and directed by coppola , the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously . \\ncoppola\\'s most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself , which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy\\'s unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company\\'s hotshot attorney ) . \\nthe inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous , but danes is as superb as always . \\nthen , of course , there is damon , who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy\\'s often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat . \\nas good as he is in the rainmaker , damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting , directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself . \\ndamon plays the title character , will hunting , a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius . \\nin an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction , an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend , community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , to counsel the abrasive , standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life . \\ngood will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests , but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon\\'s intelligent script touches . \\neven though no one ( and , if so , _very_ few people ) can directly relate to will\\'s burden of superhuman intelligence , the insecurities he suffers are universal . \\nthe material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors . \\nwilliams delivers a nice dramatic turn ; affleck , a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy ) , turns up in a warm and charming performance as will\\'s best friend ; and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as will\\'s harvard-schooled love interest . \\nthe clear standout in the cast , though , is damon , who bravely does not soften will\\'s prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him . \\nso many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine , but based on his impressive work in john grisham\\'s the rainmaker and especially good will hunting , it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come . \\n',\n",

       " b\"the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work . \\nthis slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal . \\nwhen the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case . \\nupon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home . \\nas the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed . \\ndid dolores kill her husband ? \\nand did she kill her employer ? \\ndolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller . \\nconsequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn . \\nkathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance . \\ndolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time . \\nshe dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks . \\nkathy bates' performance is award-calibre stuff . \\nthe rest of the cast is also very good . \\njennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores' ever-present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey . \\ndavid strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores' husband , joe st . george . \\njudy parfitt is fine as dolores' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan--it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role . \\nchild actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive . \\nthe direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey . \\nthe segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit-and-miss in terms of effectiveness . \\nthe pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up . \\nhowever , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful--i particularly like the chilling ice-blue hue permeating the present-day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots--and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film . \\nit would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited . \\nnone of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw , and its pacing may be a turn-off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe-wielding psychopaths . \\nalthough being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand . \\ndolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly . \\nhowever , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments . \\non my four-star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars . \\n\",\n",
       " b'billed as a \" feminist sex fantasy \" , this spirited , imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award-winning canadian director cynthia roberts , is destined for extreme reactions . \\ncamille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart-felt tale of the title character bubbles galore ( nina hartley ) , a porn-actress-turned-porn-producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence . \\nhowever , those in the andrea dworkin camp , will no doubt loathe the film\\'s decidedly pro-porn stance . \\npolitical considerations aside , however , this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles\\' romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers ( shauny sexton ) . \\nin the backdrop , however is bubbles\\' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky ( tracy wright ) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss . \\nthis femme-butch-femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity * and * sensuality . \\nin addition to the romantic aspects of the story , bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex-boyfriend godfrey montana ( daniel macivor ) , a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it . \\nwhen his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through , he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her . \\nthese proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence . \\ngod herself - yes , in the world of this film , god , is most definitely a \" her \" - and a chorus of undulating , scantily-clad angels , have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold , adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction . \\nthis bright , colourful and deliriously sexy film is chock-full of great performances . \\nmaking her dramatic debut , after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films , porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary \\'straight\\' actresses to shame . \\nhartley has overwhelming star power , and one wonders why other non-triple-x producers haven\\'t used her bountiful talents . \\nit is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of \" boogie nights \" , a film which takes a far more traditional doom-and-gloom approach to the porn industry . \\nmaking a cameo appearance in the role of god , former porn actress annie sprinkle , a true artist in her own right - gives the entire film an earthy , sensual glow and certainly solidifies and , by her very appearance , downright justifies the themes of the movie . \\nthe other performances are equally solid . \\ndaniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role . \\nshauny sexton , an erotic dancer and pin-up model , makes an impressive screen debut . \\noverall , bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed . \\nat one point , the title character declares that \" instead of trying to save women from the sex trade , we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work \" . \\nthe direction by cynthia roberts is daring and subversive . \\nroberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straight-ahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avant-garde montage sequences . \\nthe love scenes between the women are especially beautiful . \\nthe musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings , while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70\\'s porn and psychedelia . \\namazingly , this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies . \\nthis speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture , as one cannot imagine such an entertaining , original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day . \\nbubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not , at present , appear to have any traditional distribution in place , so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one . \\nit\\'s funny , sexy and subversive . \\nand it shouldn\\'t be missed . \\n',\n",
       " b'with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous \" ellen \" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . \\nthe birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . \\nthen along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . \\nit\\'s also noticeable that this \" alternative lifestyle \" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . \\nwhile it\\'s a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . \\nbut the way we\\'re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . \\nwhile the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . \\nit doesn\\'t poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it\\'s comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . \\nthe idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia . \\nif you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . \\nit\\'s a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . \\nit\\'s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . \\nkevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . \\nafter a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . \\nthe small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . \\nwhen cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . \\neveryone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , \" and he\\'s gay . \" \\nthe town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . \\nthe thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . \\nnaturally the questions pour from howard\\'s fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school\\'s principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . \\nthe frenzy isn\\'t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and \" entertainment tonight \" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . \\none particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of \" inside entertainment \" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . \\nthe intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . \\nit seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . \\nthe dominoes begin to tumble as howard\\'s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . \\nit all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren\\'t presented with near-perfection by one of this year\\'s most delightful ensemble casts . \\nkline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here . \\nthe great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully . \\nevery single actor turns in one of their best performances ever . \\ndillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they\\'re up to bat . \\nrudnick\\'s script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you\\'ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes . \\nwhile in & out doesn\\'t carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around . \\nthe script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we\\'re allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs . \\nit remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we\\'re still allowed a sappily touching ending . \\ndespite it\\'s subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy . \\nfrank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick\\'s script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit . \\ncheck this one out . \\nyou\\'ll have a gay old time . \\n',\n",
       " b'after having heard so many critics describe \" return to me \" as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? \\nwhat made \" return to me \" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? \\nwas it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? \\nwas it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? \\nthe charisma of the two leads ? \\neven now i can\\'t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven\\'t see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances . \\ni don\\'t think any of the romances i\\'ve seen have been classified as such . \\nwhich leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- \" return to me \" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider . \\nit was traditional , magical . \\nwe knew it couldn\\'t be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in . \\nit was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn\\'t help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings . \\nthe film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt\\'s direction . \\nfrom the very first bird\\'s eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the \" return to me \" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we\\'re in for something sweet . \\nthe scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy . \\nreal people don\\'t act that way ; real people aren\\'t that nice . \\nwe know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks\\' existence . \\nthe premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt\\'s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal . \\neverything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film . \\n>from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob\\'s wardrobes . \\nfrom the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints . \\nfrom the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part . \\n \" return to me \" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist . \\nwe care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we\\'re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father . \\nwhatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors . \\ndisappointingly , david alan grier\\'s charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written . \\nduchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder . \\ninstead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of \" the x-files . \" \\nduchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen . \\nminnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer . \\nthough an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses . \\nwhile \" return to me \" functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop . \\nthe entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife\\'s heart . \\nwe already know that there\\'s going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point . \\nas a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes , i know she\\'s supposed to have his ex-wife\\'s heart and everything--it seems too effortless . \\nthe main subject is a love story , and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) . \\nhowever , in the spirit of \" return to me , \" it won\\'t do to be too picky about how \" old \" hollywood tells its stories . \\ni loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt . \\nit shows . \\nthe bottom line : \" return to me \" is nothing remarkable , and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn\\'t imagined . \\n',\n",

\\nbulworth\\'s candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on . \\nhe feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something . \\nchicken wings , appropriately enough . \\nbulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives . \\nwhen one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment . \\nwith so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can\\'t hollywood make a quality product . \\n ( you go , warren ! ) \\nwhen they become indignant and ask why he\\'s talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it\\'s because they are rich jews . \\nthat night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them . \\nhe stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap . \\nthe next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit-and-tie fundraisers . \\nfrom then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth . \\nhis rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy . \\nhe\\'s not very good , but it is his first try and at least he\\'s not embarrassingly bad . \\nhis lobbyists are not amused , but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth . \\neventually , the movie\\'s plot ( remember he hired a hit man ? ) \\novertakes the politics , which is too bad . \\nscreen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him . \\nthere are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer . \\nthese scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth\\'s political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever-present , obvious-looking assassin . \\nstill , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen . \\nas the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co-wrote the screenplay ) . \\nas an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth\\'s depression , then liberation and rebirth . \\nas a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood\\'s indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) . \\nsomeone else probably could have directed , but since he was there anyway , what the heck . \\nit\\'s too bad that there aren\\'t more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics . \\nafter all , much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news . \\njust a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants . \\njust don\\'t expect to be popular with the insurance companies . \\n',\n",

       " b'paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i\\'d consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who\\'s managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils . \\nstarship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that\\'s nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage . \\nit\\'s not a completely successful film , but as a failure it\\'s certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one . \\nmy favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven\\'t yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ) . \\ni believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that\\'s as touching as schwarzenegger\\'s in t2 . \\nthat movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics . \\nits violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience . \\nthere\\'s a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him . \\nhe tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim\\'s every fearful tic . \\nit\\'s a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir . \\nin hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won\\'t shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on . \\nbut why ? \\nhis character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who\\'s always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster . \\nthe kind who just won\\'t die . \\nhollow man\\'s protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who\\'s saddled with the film\\'s worst lines ( \" i\\'ve lost cohesion again ! \" ) . \\nthey\\'re a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w . bush\\'s republican national convention speech ( i . e . \\nbush referring to clinton ; \" ? ? ? so much promise ? ? ? but to what end ? \\nto what end ? \" -- \\nthis actually got applause ! \\nsuddenly warren beatty doesn\\'t look so absurd ) . \\nthe rest of the film\\'s characters are all well past thirty , though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners ; is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood\\'s new character developing technique ? \\nahh , what a cynical time we live in ? ? ? \\nas the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation\\'s ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at ) . \\nthey\\'ve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine , in a twist worthy of the film\\'s 1950\\'s late show origins , to impulsively experiment on himself . \\ncaine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead . \\nour mad scientist is turned invisible ( after several fx-heavy complications ) , then he inexplicably ( it\\'s hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures , but this is never explored , and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? ) \\nbegins raping , assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases , always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger . \\nit grows abundantly clear with each new release that it\\'s verhoeven\\'s films that have become hollow . \\nlike the rest , this one is cold , heartless , and full of contempt for humanity , but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit , insight and makes no statement other than \" audiences will pay for anything these days \" . \\nit\\'s an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level , or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun , thrill-a-minute ride . \\nverhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care . \\nthe previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick . \\nhow can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self ? \\na couple weeks ago , after seeing the trailer , a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability . \\nhollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot . \\nbut oh yeah , it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway . \\nverhoeven delivers the sleazy \" goods \" , but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner , here it just feels icky and uncomfortable . \\nthe director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses , caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux-psycho music strains in the background . \\nit\\'s plainly obvious that verhoeven isn\\'t exploring voyeurism ( like in the classic peeping tom ) but exploiting it and not even doing that very well . \\nit\\'s funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman\\'s naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand . \\nmost vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks . \\nin fact it\\'s largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since , by the end , most of his potential victims don infer-red glasses that track his body heat . \\nas in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov ( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre ) , and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked . \\nthe film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy . \\nit happens when a lab assistant ( kim dickens , who looks like she stepped out of playboy ) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon , suddenly pauses . \\n \" are you looking at me ? \" , she queries , obviously haunted . \\nit\\'s a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 ( the apex of the mad slasher craze ) . \\nthose special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer . \\nand they\\'re the only reason to check out hollow man , preferably as a mid-week bargain rental . \\nyou\\'ve been warned . \\nbut you probably won\\'t listen , will you ?

       " b' \" tarzan and the lost city \" is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while . \\nnot only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . \\nunfortunately , it\\'s not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like \" heaven\\'s gate \" ( 1980 ) or \" ishtar \" ( 1987 ) were bad . \\ninstead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place . \\nwith all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? \\nof course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984\\'s \" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes \" ) down to the really bad ( 1981\\'s \" tarzan , the ape man \" with bo derek ) . \\nmost of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . \\ntherefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others . \\n \" greystoke \" added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even \" tarzan , the ape man \" at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek\\'s bare breasts . \\n \" tarzan and the lost city , \" on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue . \\nthe script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come . \\ncomic books have better plots than this . \\nthe movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer\\'s comedy \" george of the jungle . \" \\ndidn\\'t the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? \\nthe story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage . \\nwhen the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . \\nhowever , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa\\'s last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . \\nat first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man . \\nonce the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . \\nmost of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of . \\nthere are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from \" raiders of the lost ark \" ( 1981 ) to \" the goonies \" ( 1985 ) . \\nwhen the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river . \\nthe movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . \\nfor instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn\\'t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do . \\ninstead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival . \\nof course , one can\\'t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . \\nnot to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city . \\nthere is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) . \\nwhich also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it\\'s sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? \\nstrictly speaking , \" tarzan and the lost city \" isn\\'t even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien\\'s laughably stiff performance comes real close . \\nthis movie proves what \" starship troopers \" only hinted at : he cannot act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle . \\nvan dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he\\'s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . \\ni also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut . \\nwaddington makes a decent villain , although he\\'s like a charmless version of belloq from \" raiders of the lost ark . \" as jane , the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan . \\nshe does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess . \\nhowever , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news . \\n \" tarzan and the lost city \" is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . \\nso , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short . \\n',\n",

       " b'whenever u . s . government starts meddling into other countries\\' affairs , under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political , religious or ethnic persecution , the other side is ready to use mantra that says \" look who\\'s talking ! \\nwhat have you done to the indians ? \" \\nhowever , even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes . \\nhollywood is just another example , with its revisionist westerns , made in early 1990s . \\nthose movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness , coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus\\' discovery of america . \\none of such examples is geronimo : an american legend , 1993 western directed by walter hill , film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers . \\nthe hero of the film is geronimo ( played by wes studi ) , leader of apaches , fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century . \\nwhen the movie begins , in 1885 , geronimo and his apaches made peace with u . s . government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation . \\nhowever , broken promises , injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless . \\nwith not more 30 or so of his followers , he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign . \\ngeneral crook ( gene hackman ) , commander of u . s . army forces , respects geronimo and knows that even his 5 , 000 force isn\\'t enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest . \\ninstead , he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches - lt . charles gatewood ( jason patric ) and indian hunter al sieber ( robert duvall ) . \\ntogether with young lt . britton davis ( matt damon ) they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo . \\ngeronimo : an american legend , like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness , try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities , but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors . \\nso , the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies . \\nalmost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people . \\nalthough such elements of john millius\\' screenplay do indeed have some basis in history , they harm the story of geronimo . \\nto be honest , walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film , but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time . \\ninstead , they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band . \\nto make even worse , hill has some real problems with pacing and style , and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one - story about geronimo and story about his pursuers . \\nthe movie should have been better if it turned to geronimo\\'s life before and after his last uprising , in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood . \\nthe difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting . \\nwes studi , cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans , was perfect choice for geronimo , not only because he resembles geronimo , but because he induces a lot of passion in his role . \\ncontrary to him , we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies . \\nwhile this could be expected from someone like jason patric , it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall . \\neven hill\\'s directing is bellow expectations - battle scenes are too short and , like in many of his late films , force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s . \\neven his old associate , music composer ry cooder , disappoints , with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic . \\non the other hand , photography by lloyd ahern ii , with the use of red lenses , gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere , ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic . \\nall in all , compared with some of the hollywood\\'s examples of political correctness , this film isn\\'t so bad , but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better . \\n',\n",

) , \\nsomething this bad can\\'t help but look even worse . \\nthe last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year\\'s batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received . \\nsphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron\\'s the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon . \\nscience and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere\\'s first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences . \\nattempts at characterization fall apart . \\nintelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel . \\nspecial effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness . \\nbut all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful . \\nthis is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect . \\ni left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film . \\nthere is some promise , but it\\'s all in the setup . \\nwe\\'re introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered . \\nwhen one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee . \\non the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission . \\ntogether , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact . \\nfor a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation . \\nthe overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities . \\nthen , right around the one-hour mark ( that\\'s the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever\\'s left of titanic ) , the virtually non-stop action begins , and , once it starts , the script becomes superfluous . \\nthis might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but , instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things \" exciting . \" \\nadditionally , because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who\\'s more interested in technology than people ) , viewers don\\'t develop much of a rooting interest . \\nit makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience . \\nwhat about that a-list cast ? \\nnot surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn\\'t a person ; he\\'s a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue . \\ndustin hoffman isn\\'t lively or particularly good -- it\\'s ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) . \\nsharon stone and peter coyote are both flat . \\ntheir characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective . \\nthen there\\'s queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count . \\ni like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere\\'s lengthy pre-production phase ) . \\nif that\\'s the case , forgiveness is granted . \\ni\\'m less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind ) . \\neven if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton\\'s credit as a producer disallows him absolution . \\nhe was a willing participant in a creative travesty . \\nno wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year\\'s cinematic wasteland . \\nit deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth-consecutive weekend atop the box office heap . \\n',\n",

       " b\"near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . \\nthe following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . \\nat best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . \\nin 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . \\nthere have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged . \\ndreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed . \\nthe other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . \\nalthough camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . \\nunfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition . \\nin making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product . \\nthe animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date . \\nthe animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . \\nthe key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot . \\nnamely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . \\ndreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney . \\nthe story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent . \\nfor the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . \\nthe writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . \\nin fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . \\nmoses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family . \\nmoses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . \\nby this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . \\nthe cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . \\nthe script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting . \\nit's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . \\nbut for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch . \\n\",\n",
       " b'the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it\\'s adequately explained by the commercials . \\nwith 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal . \\ndeniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a \" pageant \" , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero . \\nand if there wasn\\'t anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington . \\n ( a heist comedy ? \\nyup . \\ndeniro and hoffman are \" stealing \" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) \\nwag the dog succeeds because it\\'s based one great truth : the american people are stupid . \\nok , maybe it\\'s not \" love thy neighbor as thyself \" or even \" two plus two makes four \" , but a truth nonetheless . \\n ( any average person who thinks that they\\'re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . ) \\nand because we\\'re so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won\\'t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro\\'s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won\\'t be able to locate albania on the map . \\nthe beauty of wag the dog is that it isn\\'t a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness . \\nnor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) . \\ninstead , david mamet\\'s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire . \\nit does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers\\' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion . \\ndeniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages . \\nit\\'s all : \" what do i love ? \\nwhat is it that brings me joy ? \\nbaseball , \" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat . \\nhe threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he\\'s doing it in a very nice , polite way . \\nit\\'s a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script . \\nhoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous . \\nthis kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he\\'s so excited that he can\\'t even shut up . \\neven on the edge of disaster , he\\'s bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive . \\ninsiders note that he\\'s basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have . \\nthe best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast . \\nthe characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don\\'t . \\nanne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside . \\ndenis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the \" fad king \" , who handles the profitable \" back-end \" -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money . \\nthey could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i\\'d go see it . \\nwillie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious \" ballad of the green berets \" parody . \\nwoody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated \" hero \" of the albanian conflict . \\ncraig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift . \\n ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) \\nwag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . \\nwe can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . \\nwag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don\\'t . \\n',\n",

\\noh , it\\'s just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey\\'s in it ? \\nit\\'s gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? \\ncan\\'t be that good ) . \\nthis is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint . \\nmake sense ?

\\ni think it is , and i\\'ll tell you why . \\na good critic should be able to view the film from the \" average joe ( or jane ) \" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film . \\nsometimes that can be tough . \\n \" the acting was superb , but i was bored \" or \" i loved it ! ! \\nit was sooooo cheezy ! \" \\nmight be used to describe a film . \\nthese are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique . \\nbut which is more important ? \\nand which is better ? \\nan extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? \\ngetting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we\\'re reflecting what the public wants to know anyway . \\nevery average person out there who\\'s interested in this film is likely to ask \" how does it compare to pulp fiction ? \" \\nand so , as a critic , i\\'m already responsible to ask that same question . \\njackie brown stars pam grier , the \" blaxploitation \" heroine from the 1970\\'s , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character . \\ntarantino\\'s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta\\'s sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier . \\n ( we\\'ve made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction\\'s samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) . \\nordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars . \\ntrouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed . \\nnaturally this proves an obstacle to ordell\\'s plans and , not as friendly intended as we\\'d hope , he posts jackie\\'s bail after she is put behind bars . \\nthe thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he\\'s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way . \\njackie finds herself in a tight squeeze . \\nordell won\\'t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she\\'s always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . \\nit comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? \\nwhat ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself . \\ncoming into play is another 70\\'s veteran , robert forster as jackie\\'s bail bondsmen max cherry . \\nmax\\'s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . \\nalso involved is ordell\\'s \" surfer girl \" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand . \\nfonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there\\'s nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . \\nde niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . \\nde niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn\\'t need a de niro to play him . \\ncompared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . \\nin pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn\\'t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . \\ntarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . \\nsadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life . \\njackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn\\'t as awesome as the first time . \\njules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . \\nand although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don\\'t think he\\'s quite as irreplaceable . \\nin fact , maybe a new face would have been better . \\njackson could\\'ve remained tarantino\\'s jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . \\nsadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn\\'t as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . \\nanother problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . \\nthis is grier\\'s film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? \\nit not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story . \\nit is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino\\'s quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard\\'s novel \" rum punch \" . \\nfor those movie-goers , don\\'t expect another pulp fiction and you\\'ll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90\\'s film- making . \\nthe directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we\\'re still reminded that this is tarantino\\'s movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints . \\nso getting back to the question that i began with , this isn\\'t pulp fiction at all . \\nit\\'s good , but it isn\\'t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place . \\nthis is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won\\'t satiate true fans . \\nif you can realize that this isn\\'t going to knock your socks off , then you\\'ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet . \\nafter all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy . \\n',\n",

of this film is that while , yes , it\\'s an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that\\'s not necessarily the problem with the film . \\nit\\'s that it\\'s just kind of unsatisfying . \\nif this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way . \\nbut this film just seems to end , and i don\\'t want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won\\'t bitch about what is , essentially , genuine . \\nbut the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it . \\nit\\'s rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who\\'s shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he\\'s manipulative and he always wins . \\nit wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full . \\nwe see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don\\'t fully believe it . \\nand i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film\\'s conclusion that of incompleteness . \\nin the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases . \\nin short , he\\'s full of bullshit and we know it . \\nin the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river . \\npoint one , it\\'s not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren\\'t nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success ) . \\npoint two , it has been through several lawyers . \\nafter turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out . . . is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h . macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town\\'s company . \\nthey spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in \" wilde , \" pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant . \\nthey also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on ) . \\nas we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis ) . \\nthings begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money . \\nas macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , \" fargo \" ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist . \\nin fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic . . . i \\nsuppose like a grisham novel ) . \\nthis wouldn\\'t be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good , he\\'s seen as being still full of bullshit . \\nbecause he doesn\\'t take stock in the cares of his partners , and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town , he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out . \\nthe final half tries to redeem this , as must have been the point of making this in zallian\\'s mind , but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs , and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he\\'s seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him ( and thusly receiving two speeding tickets ) , we still feel that the big change in his life is that he\\'s not rich and esteemed anymore ( the film\\'s final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow ) . \\nthe fault is not that there is no closure to the court case ( it\\'s still going on , you know ) , but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has . \\nwe need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life , and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life . \\nit only feels like half of that . \\nmaybe even less . \\nand it\\'s not travolta , who does a great job here ( though never to be a truly memorable performance of his ) , but rather zallian , whose final chapter needs a rewrite . \\nup to then , though , it\\'s an engrossing drama , one of the best of the year in fact , and one of the best lawyer films , period . \\nthe reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted , but rather it\\'s about the lawyers , the knights who battle eachother . \\nwe learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town , but the reason it can\\'t be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find . \\nand duvall\\'s facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it\\'s almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is . \\nfacher is seen as an elderly man , a goofy eccentric , carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it , eating lunches out of paper bags , and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio , and scold anyone who interupts him . \\nbut look deeper and you see a master at work : his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him , and it\\'s difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way . \\nthat\\'s why i liked this film : it\\'s hard to put a pointer on . \\nyou can never see exactly where this film will land , and even when the credits roll , you still aren\\'t sure what to make of it . \\ncall it the zallian effect . \\nsame thing happened with \" schindler\\'s list \" ( not that i\\'m comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman ) . \\neach film is so greatly crafted that you can\\'t help but get involved in its broad storytelling , interesting characters , and , most peculiarly , the wit that comes along with it . \\nif only it felt totally complete ( like , say , \" schindler\\'s list , \" though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two ) , it might have been one of the best films of the year , and along with that , a full breath of fresh air . \\n',\n",

       " b'when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , \" dangerous liaisons for kids ! \" \\nit was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears\\' 1988 masterpiece . \\nimagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits . \\nand i was impressed . \\nin fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie . \\nit\\'s kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs . \\ni suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they\\'re smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined . \\ncruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do . \\ni also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be . \\nphillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont . \\nwow . \\nisn\\'t that a memorable name ? \\ni could just say it over and over again . \\nsebastian valmont . \\nit kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich . \\nsebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can\\'t have , no material object out of his reach . \\nhe has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips . \\nand , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don\\'t really exist . \\nthe ones who do are irritating . \\nsebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants . \\nsince these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons . \\nkathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn . \\nbut it\\'s too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the \" paradigm of chastity and beauty . \" \\nso , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) . \\nbut -- dear god ! \\n-- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove . \\ndangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting . \\ncruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting . \\nkathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her . \\nshe is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons . \\ngellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive . \\nwitherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn\\'t the moral staple she\\'s supposed to be : sure , she won\\'t have sex until she\\'s in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible . \\nbut i can\\'t forget mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness . \\ni have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions . \\nand there\\'s one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone . \\ntrue , he is bad , but it doesn\\'t help that he has no character to work with . \\nkumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch . \\nthe film fails in every other way , too . \\nfirst of all , nobody talks like this . \\neven the \" intellectuals \" i know don\\'t bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering . \\nfor a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there\\'s no way we can join it . \\ncruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene . \\nearlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie . \\nso , if we hate them , then what\\'s the point of an extended sex scene ? \\ntitillation , of course . \\nit can\\'t even work under the pretense of \" meaningful love scene , \" because we hate the characters . \\nit\\'s interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons . \\nkumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film ; many of the scenes have a similar tone , and there are moments in frears\\' film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene , in which [spoiler warning ! ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers ) . \\nbut kids don\\'t act like this . \\nnobody acts like this . \\nin his translation , roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements . \\nthe result is a picture of confounding badness , a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it\\'s really deep and profound . \\ni\\'ll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences , but that doesn\\'t change the fact that it\\'s awful . \\n',\n",
       " b\"dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! \\nregardless of what i say about knock off , you can't grasp its awfulness from my words . \\nyou have to see it and experience it for yourself . \\nhere's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so . \\nyes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure . \\nin fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story . \\ndon't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off . \\nit reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was . \\nit also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme . \\nit does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark . \\nas i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness . \\nnow , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn't , but it's still a fascinating kind of mess . \\ni don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off . \\nfor the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing . \\ni paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap ) . \\ni don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film . \\nray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there's no problem . \\nrob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film . \\nlela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! \\nin fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do . \\nin that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense . \\nbut what a strange mess it is . \\nit was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours . \\ncan this be the same man ? \\ni don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . \\nknock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here . \\nfor instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . \\nwhy ? \\nwho knows . \\nwhat are the implications of this ? \\ni have no idea . \\nmost action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . \\nknock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . \\nthe acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . \\nsorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . \\nvan damme is bad , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . \\nthe only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . \\ntsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . \\nthey're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe . \\nbut his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ?

       " b\"2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off . \\nit basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways . \\ni'm not going into much greater detail than that , since it would take forever to explain , and quite frankly , i'm not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that i've already wasted . \\nwhile it tries very hard to be pulp fiction , 2 days in the valley falls way short . \\nthis is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello , james spader and jeff daniels . \\nwhile the story isn't much , and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better , 2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots . \\njames spader's character , while not much better than the rest , is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way . \\nand we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron ( in her first role ) . \\nyou know a movie isn't that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women . \\neven if they are both gorgeous . \\ni will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted . \\nbut marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result . \\nwhile some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting , they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about . \\nif i were to put a number on it , only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch . \\nthis is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent , and even then prepare for disappointment . \\nnot even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again . \\nor at least not all of it anyway . \\n\",\n",
       " b' \" rebel without a cause \" is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to . \\neveryone feels that they are different in some way , that they don\\'t belong in some places and \" rebel without a cause \" successfully shows on screen these universal emotions . \\nno matter what generation you belong to , these feelings are present . \\nthis is why james dean is admired by america , because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute . \\nin our minds , we just try to do the right thing just like dean\\'s jim stark does . \\nnot only does \" rebel without a cause \" display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure . \\neach generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection . \\nthis is because times change and in response people change . \\nno matter how popular you were once , as your generation grows older , newer breeds look at you in a different light . \\nthis is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents . \\neven if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past , the teens could not believe this . \\nin one humorous scene , stark , his girlfriend judy ( natalie wood ) , and his pal plato ( sal mineo ) pretend they are adults . \\nthey use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored . \\nthis scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another . \\nspeaking on behalf of my generation , i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by . \\nthe only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation . same \\ngoes for brando , redford , even deniro . \\ni can only imagine how vaguely matt damon , ben affleck , and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century . \\nwill dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten ? \\nany film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film . \\neven if \" rebel without a cause \" has some ridiculous scenes ( the game of chicken - did people really act this way ? ) , an unbelievable conclusion ( how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end ? ) , and a silly romance ( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours ) it still is a fabulous film . \\nthe acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool . \\nnow , however , the coolness is fading . . . \\n',\n",
       " b'let\\'s get this one over with as quickly as possible . \\nif there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming . \\nbut as it is , \" godzilla \" is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio . \\nproducer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch \" last year at merienbad \" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot . \\nno amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs . \\ndracula ) . \\n \" godzilla \" opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs . \\nwe are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins ) . \\nwell , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature . \\nlater , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor . \\nin a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word \" gojira \" ( the japanese name of the famed beast ) . \\nwe are then introduced to dr . nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film ) . \\nhe is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population . \\nhe is immediately drafted by the u . s . military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature . \\nin a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u . s . and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica . \\nwell , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york . \\nwhen the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york ) . \\nthe military , with dr . tatopoulos\\'s help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system . \\nit finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr . tatopoulos who snaps the beast\\'s picture . \\nthe monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage . \\nworking from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr . totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated ) . \\nwell the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant . \\nneedless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster\\'s nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn\\'t dead yet ) . \\ni sincerely hope that i\\'ve completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film . \\ni gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour\\'s wage on this tripe . \\neverything about \" godzilla \" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast . \\nthe script ( and let\\'s be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years \" razzie \" award . \\nthe dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr . tatopoulos\\' estranged girlfriend ) and mr . broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) . \\nthe film could be enjoyably campy if it didn\\'t take itself so damn seriously . \\nbut to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind . \\nno . godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it . \\nthe film is bleak and ugly looking . \\ntaking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth . \\neverything is ugly and dark . \\nnew york has never looked so inhospitable since \" death wish \" . \\nin an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue . \\nthe only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica , where dr . tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint . \\nthe scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up . \\nyou know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint . \\nfor a scientist , this is very poor observation . \\nlet\\'s look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) : \\n1 . ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ? \\n2 . ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ? \\ni don\\'t think iguana\\'s have a habit of migrating . \\n3 . ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ? \\n4 . ) the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it\\'s suspension cables . \\n5 . ) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly ? \\nif so , then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures . \\n ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide . \\ngodzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all ) . \\n6 . ) godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters , but new york cabs are made of stronger steel . \\n7 . ) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters , bullets , torpedoes and missiles , but can\\'t catch you on foot . \\n8 . ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla . \\n9 . ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can\\'t tear through the park avenue tunnel . \\n10 . ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ? \\nmaybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel . \\n11 . ) galapagos iguana\\'s actually live in the french polynesian islands ? \\n12 . ) why was dr . tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ? \\n13 . ) how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day , and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey ? \\n14 . ) new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting . \\nnew yorkers hate beta cam . \\ni could go on and on , but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is . \\ndon\\'t be fooled , this film has less gray matter than any episode of \" america\\'s funniest home videos \" . \\nthe performances in the film are singularly bland . \\nnot one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror . \\nthe characters , in the midst of the onslaught , have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee , failed relationships , career choices . \\nthe only common occurrence that doesn\\'t take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement , but then that would have made them believable . \\ngodzilla for the most part is okay . \\nthe design of the beast is funky , if not very memorable . \\none thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath . \\nnow , i for one can\\'t quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait . \\na good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly . \\nthere is so much wrong with this film that i can\\'t really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my divorce ) . \\nany film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac . \\nthe addition of the baby raptors ( ah , i meant godzillas ) , are nothing but a direct rip off of \\'jurassic park \" , but with none of that film\\'s suspense or tension . \\nsuffice to say that , \" godzilla \" is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade . \\nthis is a film that needed the hype . \\nwith the current level of writing and directing , nothing else about the film succeeds . \\nif you\\'ve seen the trailers , you\\'ve seen the best parts . \\nmy only suggestion for mr . d and mr . e . is that they could always go back to selling shoes . \\n . this film could be the next \" rocky horror \" . \\nonly it\\'s not funny ! \\n',\n",
       " b'in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . \\nsir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . \\nhis oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . \\nthe daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . \\nhopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . \\nwhichever one you like , dear , he says . \\nand the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . \\ni liked that scene for two reasons . \\nfirst , the cakes looked really cool . \\nsecond , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . \\nmeet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . \\nit\\'s easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it\\'s even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . \\nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . \\ni know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . \\ncase in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . \\nhowever , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . \\n ( it\\'s not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) \\nit shouldn\\'t take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . \\nand indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . \\nwell , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . \\nso , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . \\nanyway , the deceased lawyer\\'s body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . \\nthe idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . \\nif this weren\\'t hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who\\'s wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn\\'t know how to act in our society . \\nit also doesn\\'t help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . \\nhe claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . \\nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . \\nhe knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . \\nand as played by brad pitt , he\\'s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he\\'s just there . \\nit\\'s as if someone told pitt , \" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . \" \\nit\\'s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . \\ni\\'ve used the phrase \" angel of death \" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt\\'s performance with this year\\'s best angel performance , nicolas cage\\'s in city of angels . \\nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . \\nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . \\ncage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani\\'s character is so shallow that she can\\'t see beyond pitt\\'s good looks . \\nthe movie\\'s other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn\\'t save meet joe black . \\nsir anthony hopkins isn\\'t given much better material to work with , unfortunately . \\nhe plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . \\n ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins\\'s character more realistically evil . ) \\nhopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . \\nof course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder . \\nbut i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . \\nhopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . \\nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i\\'m sure . \\ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i\\'m asking myself why . \\nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i\\'m going to do now . \\ngo spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap . \\ndon\\'t go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .

       " b'in my opinion , a movie reviewer\\'s most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion . \\nbut with soul survivors , i\\'m so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned . \\nhowever , protocol forces me to do otherwise . \\nsoul survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends : cassandra ( melissa sagemiller ) is sweet and innocent . \\nparty girl annabel ( eliza dushku of bring it on ) is dating world-weary harvard student matt ( wes bentley ) . \\nmatt still has feelings for cassie , who is now dating sean ( casey affleck ) . \\ndriving back from a creepy , gothic party , the quartet gets into a horrific car crash . \\nsean dies , leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty , made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her . \\nas cassie mopes through her classes , she sees the ghost of sean all over the place , urging her to follow him . \\nalong with being plagued by other ghastly visions , cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party . \\nannabel and matt try calming her down , but no one shares cass\\'s visions . \\nshe has to figure out this purgatory all by herself . \\nrarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material . \\nin his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion . \\nwhen the movie\\'s camerawork isn\\'t pedestrian , it\\'s clich ? d . \\ncarpenter\\'s need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation . \\nwe already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? \\nand the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . \\ncarpenter\\'s script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness . \\nthis is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around . \\nthe second lamest device , of course , is the , \" oh , it was all a dream \" resolution . \\nand guess what ? \\nthis movie has both ! \\nnot that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile . \\nsince there\\'s no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere . \\nthat\\'s a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples . \\ncarpenter can\\'t even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it . \\n[the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats . \\n-ed . ] \\nwhen sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts . \\nand when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint , they\\'re fully clothed . \\nregardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity . \\nwhy wouldn\\'t they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ? \\nwhy would they shower in their clothes ? \\nwhat if they weren\\'t covered in latex paint ? \\nthe cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes . \\ni felt sorry for affleck , who i\\'ve liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty . \\ndushku , who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality , has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan . \\nas for sagemiller ( star of the aforementioned get over it ) , i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person , and not an object for gawking . \\nand i\\'m not even getting into luke wilson\\'s role as a priest . \\nat least he\\'s friends with wes anderson . \\nbottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it . \\n',\n",
       " b\"as a hot-shot defense attorney , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients . \\nhe is also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness's testimony . \\nand , on top of that , he's a damn good trial lawyer . \\nin the opening scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty , but it doesn't hamper lomax's desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt , thereby getting an acquittal . \\nhis unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country , headed by john milton ( al pacino ) . \\nhe is brought to their headquarters in nyc , where he immediately impresses milton , and is subsequently offered a full-time position as head of their newly-created criminal law division . \\nlomax is soon given the case of his life . \\nhe must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide . \\nthe draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell . \\nhe works late , defends the guilty , pledges his soul to his firm , and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) . \\nbut what starts off as a promising john grisham-like story about conscience-stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story . \\nit begins like a typical parable where a small-town boy makes it big , but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money , power , and greed . \\nbut milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm . \\nquite literally , he is the devil in disguise , and as the movie progresses , he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago . \\nfreaky and frightening things begin to happen , and after much of the film has elasped , milton's horrifying intent is finally revealed . \\nthe movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts . \\nthe first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big-city trial lawyer . \\nthe second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax . \\nunfortunately , the two never mix well into a cohesive story , and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere . \\ngranted , the film is very handsome-looking . \\nyou'll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino . \\nyou'll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties . \\nyou'll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann , knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away . \\nthis was one of the better storylines , but unfortunately , is only a sub-plot . \\nas with all thing's involving the devil , you can expect nothing but the worst . \\nin the first few scenes , reeves anchors the film , but then slowly drifts into the background . \\nhis path from self-vanity to self-consciousness is never fully explored . \\nhis actions seem arbitrary , and his reasons for them not fully known . \\npacino's comical portrayal is spirited , but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie . \\nthere is another plot or two that is introduced , but never gets revisited . \\nthe focus seemed inconsistent throughout , and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap . \\nthis movie tries to be horrifying , thrilling , and dramatic all at the same time . \\nhowever , while the devil's advocate strives to get noticed , ultimately it makes very little impression at all . \\n\",\n",
       " b'i am a steven seagal fan . \\ni only say this now because \" mufti splenetik \" isn\\'t my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things . \\nany proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on . \\nseagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we\\'ll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it\\'s a real-life model-wife who hasn\\'t worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine . \\nnot to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he\\'s been in since nico doing his \" my hands are sharp , nimble knives \" thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull . \\nin the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest . \\nhe\\'s also put on quite a lot of weight . \\nsmall potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain\\'t broke , why fix it ? \\n ( more on this disappointed person\\'s dashed expectations later ) . \\nas jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past . \\nwhile he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole . \\nit turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can\\'t trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that \" glimmer man \" thing . \\nan increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole\\'s former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons . \\nthe glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) . \\nit\\'s the other changes that disappoint . \\nfor example , although there\\'s a fair amount of violence in this movie , there\\'s also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television\\'s \" in living colour . \" \\nwayans plays whiney straightman to seagal\\'s bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his \" are you crazy \" part of the dialogue with wasted zest . \\nas campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner\\'s eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal\\'s wooden comebacks make for painful watching . \\na cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble . \\nhe chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies . \\nagain , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual . \\nheck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film . \\nis that a lot to ask of the seague ?

       " b'_dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential . \\nmitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs . \\nbut as the trailer goes , \" there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . \" \\nso he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . \\nthis should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit . \\nin fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam\\'s father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie . \\nso for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a \\nheart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise . \\nnot that there isn\\'t a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort . \\nthere are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam\\'s impotent father\\'s ongoing lust for them . \\nand for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america\\'s_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . \\nbut the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ? \\nthe answer is a resounding no . \\nit\\'s not that macdonald isn\\'t a funny guy . \\nhe was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn\\'t hurt that he\\'s a natural , likable screen presence . \\nhe is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don\\'t work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) . \\nstill , macdonald\\'s few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . \\nthe late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance . \\nsaget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time . \\nthe film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . \\ncome to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ . \\n',\n",
       " b\"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nmilos forman's first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia's the people vs . \\nlarry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s . \\nthe film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky . \\ncut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati . \\nthe strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter . \\nthis evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history . \\nwhat sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost . \\nthe people vs . \\nlarry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt's true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations . \\nconsidering the serious nature of the film's theme - the importance of the united states' first amendment - the people vs . \\nlarry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous . \\nmuch of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity . \\nthe film's focus is on the flynt's many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs . \\nlarry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea . \\nlarry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side . \\nthere's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking . \\nultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea's love for each other . \\nwoody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt . \\nharrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film . \\ncourtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn , completely raw and impulsive . \\nit's a very solid performance , brash and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it's difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead-on . \\nedward norton , as flynt's straight , level-headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co-stars in the people vs . \\nlarry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film . \\none can sense the frustration that norton's character feels when harrelson's free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton's isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges . \\nmilos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic . \\nthere's also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining . \\ntwo minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs . \\nlarry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech . \\nconsequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and setting up the characters , seem unduly rushed ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion . \\nit also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a superficial level some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level . \\nfor example , why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton ( president carter's sister ) to be born-again is a mystery to me . \\nthen again , perhaps it was to him as well . \\nthese two points don't detract greatly from the film . \\nthe people vs . \\nlarry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story . \\n\",\n",

       " b'in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural \" rush hour \" - to the tune of about $250 million . \\nyou don\\'t mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in \" rush hour 2 . \" \\nthe combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in \" rush hour \" that played well to audiences around the world . \\nthe formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable . \\ni\\'m never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations . \\nsurprisingly , \" rush hour 2 \" wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it . \\nthe script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start . \\nterrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime . \\nconcurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights . \\ninstead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars . \\nthe makers of \" rush hour 2 \" are working at a distinct advantage over the original . \\nwe , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already-existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around . \\nthat chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit . \\nlittle time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in \" rush hour . \" \\nfirst and foremost to me , in \" rh2 , \" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan\\'s artistry in fight choreography . \\nthe 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint . \\nchan\\'s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket . \\nhis moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino . \\nlike harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch . \\nchris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys . \\nwhen he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun . \\nwhen lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff . \\nthe comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills . \\nthe combo of chan\\'s flying feet and fists with tucker\\'s fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the \" lethal weapon \" films . \\nthe supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently . \\njohn lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance ) . \\nlone doesn\\'t chew scenery or make pronouncements to \" get lee and carter , \" but gives the chief bad guy elegance . \\nzhang zi-yi ( \" crouching tiger , hidden dragon \" ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky\\'s taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter . \\n ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one-on-one melee at the conclusion . ) \\nroselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina -

       " b'there\\'s no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story . \\nbut if it\\'s an accurate picture of life on america\\'s mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought . \\nfor from the film\\'s outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction . \\nour eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be . \\nbrasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a \" wiseguy \" . \\nregrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well . \\nhis concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband\\'s gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing . \\ntrue , the focus on pistone\\'s family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins . \\nthe unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily . \\nthe biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors . \\nthe awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70\\'s , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces\\' costume drama casino . \\nmore importantly , pacino\\'s presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively . \\ndonnie brasco\\'s take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious . \\nlefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music . \\ninexplicably , lefty\\'s horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us . \\nit doesn\\'t any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone\\'s . \\njust think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface . \\nin these pictures pacino\\'s dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations . \\ndonnie brasco\\'s tawdry little crime , therefore isn\\'t so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them . \\n ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone\\'s superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a \" damn you mcbain ! \" \\ni hear from springfield way ? ) \\nso the movie is cliched . \\nbig deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ? \\nwell you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre . \\ndonnie brasco fails on both counts . \\nthe action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp\\'s woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades . \\nadmittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr . white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm . \\ndepp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star-struck , for he is completely hell-bent on mimicking pacino\\'s well-earned high style . \\nthe consequences are painful to watch . \\nits no exaggeration to say that the film\\'s credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family\\'s uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner\\'s phony brooklyn accent . \\nperhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco . \\nmaybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks . \\nif this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america\\'s underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes . \\ndepp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats . \\nwho knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ? \\nbut then again , perhaps donnie brasco isn\\'t so true after all . \\n',\n",

\" \\na guest asks impatiently . \\n \" forty million , \" groeteschele responds wryly . \\nthe problem with groeteschele\\'s mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . \\nthe only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . \\ngroeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . \\nyet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o\\'herlihy ) has often recommended . \\non the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . \\nsuch a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . \\n \" fail-safe \" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . \\nwhy continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? \\nis it wise ? \\nis it even logical ? \\nno , not really . \\nalthough \" fail-safe \" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way . \\nagain , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film\\'s most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance . \\nin addition to providing the central \" pro-nuclear war \" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . \\nthe context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . \\none of groeteschele\\'s \" logical \" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it\\'s merely absurd . \\nhe labels the average marxist an \" unfeeling , calculating machine \" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . \\ngroeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia\\'s home soil--which must be preserved at all costs . \\ngroeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would . \\nthe irony here is groeteschele\\'s own mechanical theorizing . \\nhe is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn\\'t even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . \\nonce the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . \\njust how will the soviet union\\'s leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ?

       " b'maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it\\'s not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month , because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker , broadcasted on abc on a monday night , starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth , respectively . \\nbecause it\\'s not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it\\'s so great . \\nunderneath the to-die-for cinematography , the brilliant acting , and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty , not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it , tell it in a certain original way . \\nit doesn\\'t merely go from plot point to plot point . \\nit goes from character to character . \\nit obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all , and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters , both musicians , who have a totally unique relationship . \\nit\\'s that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball , shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this , unlike \" patch adams , \" effortlessly emotional and real . \\nin short , this movie is just awesome . \\nit merely tells its story really well , and that\\'s something that just has to be commended these days , when most stories are botched because they\\'re not told by great storytellers . \\ndirector anand tucker tells this story well . \\nhe overdramaticizes everything , but still keeps it real . \\nthe film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr ? ( rachel griffiths and emily watson , respectively ) , two sisters who are first seen in childhood ( played by auriol evans and keely flanders , respectively ) as the very best of friends . \\nthey are also both musicians , hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist , and when it all begins , both are considered child prodigies , but hilary is seen as the better of the two . \\njackie , a bit jealous , works and works at her playing skills , and soon the tables are turned . \\nwhen they both hit adulthood , hilary strives for a comeback , while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world , but instead of fame , captures the heart of a hapless , joyful conductor , kiffer finzi ( david morissey , in a semi-star-making turn ) . \\nthey marry , after a short courtship , and move to a lovely country house , making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life : when she plays , she has the eyes of the world , but when she stops , she\\'s alone . \\nshe enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist , daniel barenboim ( james frain ) , in hopes that she may overcloud her sister , but she eventually begins to lose it , and runs away to hilary\\'s country home , where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband , since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure . \\nit\\'s all terribly melodramtic , as you can see , and by the time jackie has contracted ms ( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semi-smiliar \" shine \" in technical and emotional devastation ) , it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn\\'t been handled in such a way . \\nthe key thing here is that it\\'s not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it\\'s about her tumultuous relationship with her sister , which , i might add , is perfectly realized . \\ntheir relationship is the most down-to-earth complex entity of the year : they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world , but they\\'re also completely jealous of one another . \\nwhen a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities , she tries in vain to make a comeback but can\\'t , and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success . \\nwhen jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man , she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i\\'ve ever seen in a film ( only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man ) . \\nand the whole time , their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested . \\nanother thing i really liked is emily watson\\'s performance . \\ni usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease ( or any combination of the three ) . \\nmy reasoning for this is that it\\'s a fucking easy job . \\nthe worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in \" beloved \" : sure , she\\'s good , but what\\'s so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around , slurs her words together , and acts like a three year old inside a 20-year old\\'s body ? \\nhell , i could play that if i had a pair of breasts . \\nin that same exact movie , though , is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane , her brothers run off never to be seen again , and her mother\\'s lover is scared off . \\nshe has to actually deal with real emotions , something much harder than mere stumbling about . \\nbut the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons . \\nif you don\\'t believe me , look at jack nicholson\\'s performance in \" as good as it gets \" : great performance , but easy job . \\nthis isn\\'t so for watson , though , because her insanity comes from real emotions , not just a plot point . \\nand thanks to the opening sequence , where we see her and hilary as kids , we understand the motives behind all her actions , and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life , we\\'ve already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses . \\nrachel griffiths , who would have otherwise been the understudy to watson\\'s protagonist , actually matches watson step-for-step , because as watson grows insane , and demands unspeakable things from her , griffiths holds her own , and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her . \\ngriffiths , an otherwise unknown actress ( and watson being famous from \" breaking the waves \" and \" the boxer \" ) , is absolutely brilliant , just as absolutely brilliant as watson is , and if the academy and all the other critics groups , who\\'ve already deemed watson\\'s performance the best of the year , glance over hers because she\\'s the one who doesn\\'t get to go insane ( read : she gets the boring role ) , then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me . \\nafter all , griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real - the tom cruise role in \" rainman \" ( the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman ) . \\nshe does , and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year , it\\'s griffiths . \\ntogether , the two actresses work extremely well , though , and both have to go through deep emotional hell , the likes of which haven\\'t been seen this year . \\nif it hadn\\'t been for an otherwise not-totally-great final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary ( when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety ) , i\\'d say this is one of the top ten best films of the year . \\nit\\'s so close to perfection , in its structure , its treatment of its subject , and its beautiful technical specifications ( cinematography nomination , without a shred of doubt in my mind , and maybe film editing ) , that it\\'s nearly a shame that it\\'s not the flawless gem that it should be . \\nbut , hey , as it is , i can hardly complain . \\n',\n",

       " b'before even seeing a single frame of the film , it would be easy to snicker at deep impact , in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet . \\nit is the latest entry in this decade\\'s dubious revival of the \\'70s disaster film , and the first of two \" the sky is falling \" flicks to hit screens this year ( the other being this coming july\\'s armageddon , in which a meteor is the threat ) . \\nits tagline , \" oceans rise . \\ncities fall . \\nhope survives \" is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight ( \" they came in alone . . . the only way out . . . \\nis together \" ) , but it\\'s every bit as treacly . \\nthe opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at . \\nthe cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions , such as the usual opening \" roll call , \" in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced . \\nthe most prominent of the \" personal \" stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) , who is distraught that her father ( maximilian schell ) left her mother ( vanessa redgrave ) for a younger woman ( rya kihlstedt ) . \\nwhat is just as snicker-worthy is how this co-venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration , microsoft and nbc\\'s cable news network msnbc , which employs jenny , who is the film\\'s ostensible main character . \\nin the vision of america presented here , msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home , when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country . \\nthe initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante\\'s peak , but there\\'s one thing about deep impact i underestimated : the skills of director mimi leder . \\nshe won an emmy for her helming work on nbc\\'s smash er , which is essentially a weekly disaster movie , each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises . \\nthe challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold : ( 1 ) to make the audience care for these guest characters , regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are , and ( 2 ) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic . \\nhaving passed the \" er challenge \" in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker , leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin\\'s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen . \\nas the countdown to impact progresses , the ominous feeling of doom is palpable , leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension . \\nthere\\'s nothing here that will profoundly move anyone , but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects . \\nsituations that initially feel contrived , such as jenny\\'s familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) and comet discoverer leo biederman ( elijah wood ) , achieve some poignance ; and even the more vaguely drawn characters , including u . s . president tom beck ( morgan freeman ) , astronaut spurgeon \" fish \" tanner ( robert duvall ) , and his rather faceless crew ( ron eldard , jon favreau , mary mccormack , blair underwood , and alexander baluyev ) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraft messiah , have their share of touching moments . \\nthe latter fact owes a debt to the actors , who all do a solid job and are well-cast , with the possible exception of leoni ; she delivers a decent performance , but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster . \\nalthough its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work ( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular ) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister , it is the first of the \\'90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true--a film that makes a genuine impact , even if it isn\\'t as deep as hoped . \\n',\n",

       " b'jacques tati\\'s 1953 classic \" les vacances de m . hulot \" ( also known as \" mr . hulot\\'s vacation , \" in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film . \\nthe characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week\\'s vacation . \\nyet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory . \\npart of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags . \\nslapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don\\'t watch where they\\'re going . \\nin \" les vacances de m . hulot , \" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key . \\nin one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat . \\nwhile crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it . \\nwhen he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues . \\ntati doesn\\'t waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film . \\nit has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience\\'s expectations , and \" les vacances de m . hulot \" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well . \\ntati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement . \\nwhen hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark . \\ntati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , \" oh , he\\'s not going to do that again , \" but , lo and behold , he does . \\nfor example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot\\'s noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel\\'s lights coming on one by one . \\nthen this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce . \\nthe ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy . \\nas much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did . \\nthe other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters . \\nit easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons . \\ninstead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem . \\n \" les vacances de m . hulot \" is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events . \\nanyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store . \\nnote : \" les vacances de m . hulot \" was not rated by the mpaa . \\nit would at most receive a pg rating . \\n',\n",

       " b'after hearing reviews for woody allen\\'s upteenth movie in history , \" celebrity , \" range from terribly boring to just so-so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of \" manhattan , \" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time . \\nwoody allen\\'s films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( \" manhattan \" really is one of the best-looking films i\\'ve ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city\\'s best areas , etc . ) , a fan can\\'t help but feel visibly moved . \\nthe film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word \" help \" being spelled with an airplane . \\nbeethoven\\'s 5th blasts on the soundtrack . \\nthe city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it\\'s all rather lovely to look at . \\nand then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film\\'s hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something\\'s wrong with her life or whatever . \\nit\\'s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year\\'s \" deconstructing harry \" came awfully close ) . \\nwhat the hell has happened to him ? \\nthe man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas . \\n \" bullets over broadway , \" though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off . \\n \" mighty aphrodite \" is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story . \\n \" everyone says i love you \" was more of a great idea than a great film . \\neven \" deconstructing harry \" is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films . \\nif anything , the reception of \" celebrity \" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it\\'s not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it\\'s him . \\n \" celebrity \" is , yes , a good film , but it\\'s only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film . \\ninstead of creating the great woody allen world , he\\'s created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about . \\nand he\\'s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections . \\nit\\'s like \" la dolce vita \" without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis . \\nwoody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead . \\nmuch has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh\\'s performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o\\' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation . \\nbranagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character\\'s flaws to be more apparent . \\nwoody\\'s a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he\\'s really funny and really witty and really intelligent . \\nbranagh\\'s allen is a bit more flat-out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we\\'re still not sure if he\\'s really a good person or not . \\nhis character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him . . . sorta . \\nwe then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid-life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion . \\nhe has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie \" but with a deep personal crisis \" ) . \\nas such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film . \\nafter griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is \" polymorphously perverse \" ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of \" la dolce vita . \" \\nfollowing are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen , a relationship that almost assures him success , and his continued escapades with ryder , whom he fancies most of all . \\nhis story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status . \\nwhile lee is fumbling about , selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness , davis becomes happy ( \" i\\'ve become the kind of woman i\\'ve always hated . . . and \\ni\\'m loving it . \" ) \\nwithout doing a thing . \\nthe result is a film of highs and mediums . \\nthe mediums are what take up most of the film , with sitations and scenes which don\\'t exactly work but you can\\'t help but pat allen on the back for trying . \\nbut other places are really great scenes . \\nthe opening . \\nthe sequence with theron , which is so good that i wished it hadn\\'t ended . \\na banana scene with bebe neuwirth ( droll as ever ) . \\nand , perhaps the best sequence : a romp with hot-as-hell teen idol , brandon darrow , played by none other than leo dicaprio , who is so un-dicaprio-esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film , they\\'d never look at him the same way . \\nhe ignites the screen with intensity , and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical , and totally heartbreaking for lee , who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read , and finds himself on a wild all-day ride with him . \\nthey go to atlantic city to watch a fight , they gamble , and they wind up in his hotel room , where darrow gets it on with his flame ( gretchen mol ) and he lends him one of the leftover groupies . \\nallen\\'s writing in these scenes are so good that just for them , i\\'d almost recommend the film . \\nalmost . \\nbut what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it\\'s a mess , despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself , it\\'s still a smart and insightful film . \\nthough some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish , even for this environment ) , allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities , as it may seem to be ( if it were , it\\'d be extremely out-of-touch ) , but about those who want to be celebrities , and how they equate celebrity-hood with happiness . \\nwe never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they\\'re really happy ( they may appear to be on the surface . . . ) , but we do get close enough to lee and davis\\' character . \\nlee is obsessed with the phenomenon , while davis takes is at arm\\'s length , and never gets too involved in what it is , and soon becomes one herself . \\nbesides , it\\'s witty , and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen\\'s : that great woody allen feel . \\nit may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject , and yes , as a part of woody allen\\'s oeuvre , it\\'s merely a blip ( no \" annie hall \" but it\\'s no \" shadows and fog \" either ) , but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him , and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor , like the one in the beginning , and make it work not once but twice . \\n',\n",

( vincent ) is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home-repair business . \\nhis son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman , dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his long-time waitress girlfriend joanne ( sybil ) . \\nthe title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman-10b , which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film . you \\nshould be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don\\'t make sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them . \\ndesperate to make his dream come through , ray goes to a loanshark , humorously and menacingly played by james e . moriarty , and borrows 10 grand to bet on a \" sure thing \" at freehold raceway . \\nthe horse loses and now ray has big problems , as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough . \\nthere is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray . \\nhe is undependable , mean-spirited , and stupid . \\nso when his best friend mike ( gallagher ) , the narrator of the film , gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriend--who cares ? \\nthe director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do . \\nas for ray\\'s gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen . \\nhis buddies , the college student mike and the dependable butchie ( gillan ) , and his old man , who he has this love/hate relationship with , rally to his aid . \\nand the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity , that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films , as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together . \\nthere was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting , though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star . \\nbecause of his intensity and looks , he reminds me of sean penn . \\n',\n",

\\nshould this guy be forced to do something he doesn\\'t want to do ? \\nthis appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should . \\ni\\'m not saying \" good will hunting \" is a bad film at all . \\nit\\'s a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it . \\nthe acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together . \\nwe also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will\\'s love interest , skylar . \\nthere are tons of individual moments that i adored . \\ni loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them . \\ni liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends . \\nthere are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch . \\nand there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable . \\nlike the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean\\'s first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn\\'t regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter . \\nhowever , the main flaw of the film is there\\'s too much of everything , and not enough of it either . \\nthe film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they\\'re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten . \\ntake for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face . \\nwe hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times . \\nbut this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do . \\nalso , will\\'s relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action . \\nwe see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one . \\ntheir relationship never goes beyond \" just best friends , \" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human . \\nmaybe it was just me . \\nand it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten . \\nand , of course , as in most films like this , the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten . \\nwe never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it\\'s there for plot details that anything else . \\nminnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character . \\nthe writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness . \\nsure , it feels overstuffed , but it\\'s extremely enjoyable . \\nthe dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human . \\ni think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing . \\nwhile this is probably director gus van sant\\'s most conservative film ( you\\'d hardly know it\\'s the same director of \" to die for , \" the only van sant film i\\'ve seen , really ) , it\\'s still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what\\'s this \" best picture \" deal ? ) . \\nand if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws , i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone . \\n',\n",
       " b\"imagine this scenario : you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long , excruciating cross-country car trips , far from the city and into the deserted rural routes . \\nso far , the trip is idyllic when , abruptly , your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere . \\nit is not an easy situation , but a perfectly plausible one , the panorama in which breakdown musters it's throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness . \\nit is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays , but breakdown doesn't bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful , titillating climax that by it's finale , engrosses a viewer with total absorption . \\nthe plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988's the vanishing . \\nkurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor , a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job . \\nwhen they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest , jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver , who later , will be an important player in the plot department . \\nminutes later after that , their brand new , strikingly red , jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops . \\njeff cannot detect the car's problem , so he allows amy to take a ride with red ( j . \\nt walsh ) , a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town , where jeff will meet her at a local diner . \\nit is facile for the film to turn into a pseudo-suspenser , but instead it opts for maximum fervor . \\njeff manages to re-start the car himself , but when he arrives at the diner , she is nowhere in sight . \\ndisconcerted , the coffee shop's bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife , a town about twenty miles from here . \\nthere , trouble arises . \\nand i shall not reveal anything else , since that would be spoiling the fun of what's head . \\nthere are many involving , tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck , will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam . \\nit is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil , and rooting for the good guys , in this case jeff . \\nkurt russell is one of the few top-notch hollywood actors which doesn't overblow his acting , and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses . \\nso you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter-perfect . \\nsuffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation , from a jolly man , to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one . \\nnot many well-paid actors can deliver these type of performances , but russell is one of them . \\nas an everyday man , he pulls it off extremely convincingly , what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality , which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes . \\nalthough the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences ( very well done ) yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with . \\nfaced with an enigma about his wife's whereabouts , the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters , including the cryptic villains , who in essence , make the movie what it is . \\nwhat's most impressive however , is the feature debut by writer/director jonathan mostow . \\nmostow , hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle , alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot , efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well- made affair . \\ncontrary to most american thrillers , he doesn't rely on visual flair , but on aesthetics and substance . \\nafter breakdown , he should gain vast notoriety . \\nthe villains in the movie aren't your routine out-of-this-world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective . \\nthe baddies in breakdown , all well acted , are normal , seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer , conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder . \\nthe movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks , and , of all things in the world , it is becoming rather easy to root for villains ( jon voight in anaconda ) in today's movies . \\nworth a special mentioning is j . t walsh ( who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision ) as the leader of the gang , he renders a deliciously wicked performance , temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for . \\nalfred hitchcock used suspense--and action-- not only to stimulate , but as a way of aiding his audience's fascination in his stories , which were slowly realizing man's biggest fears . \\nbreakdown yields exactly that . \\nit magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man , acting like an ordinary man , looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero . \\ndespite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock , i think , would approve of breakdown . \\n ( 1 : 33 ) \\n\",\n",
       " b'instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as \" powerful \" or \" touching \" . \\ni have a name for it myself : \" gross \" . \\nthis is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the \" rebel \" threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . \\nhow that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren\\'t present day moviegoers beyond being \" inspired \" by something like that ? \\nthis is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience\\'s intelligence . \\ninstinct\\'s plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa . \\nhe was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him . \\nafter committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison\\'s \" psychotics ward \" . \\nassigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) . \\ncaulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career . \\nof course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison . \\nand then there\\'s the inevitable \" heartless meanie \" character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder\\'s mentor . \\nhe cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell . \\nlet\\'s get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off . \\nany good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way . \\nnot good old theo . \\nno , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says \" we need to talk about this right now . \" \\nthis is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct\\'s already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it\\'s also the least of its problems . \\ndirector jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie\\'s promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs . \\nit\\'s not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) . \\nit aims to \" inspire \" rather than to touch hearts . \\nas yoda would say , inspire it does not . \\nit is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie\\'s story . \\nindeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film\\'s plot to another character . \\nthis , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence . \\ni am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation . \\ni think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever . \\noscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful . \\nhis performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink . \\ni liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling . \\ni love animals , and instinct\\'s prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with . \\nhowever this movie\\'s execution is completely unacceptable . \\ntone down the violence and this will be a chick flick . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov \\n',\n",

she\\'s also a strong actress . \\nboth performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they\\'ll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon . \\ni enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans . \\n1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry . \\nit\\'s an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) . \\nthe x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move . \\nit\\'s nice to see a risk pay off for a change . \\nactually , it\\'s nice to see a risk at all . \\n',\n",

\\napparently , just their wardrobes . \\nspice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices\\' signature hit , \" wannabe . \" \\nthe song is as grating as ever , but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much-needed shot in the arm , setting the stage for a wave of self-referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters\\' film ideas ( the film almost mirrors robert altman\\'s the player in the way the film snails into itself ) . \\nthis section of the film , involving all manner of derring-do involving a speeding bus , is perhaps its most effective , but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher , the documentary crew ) lack a satisfactory payoff . \\nspice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family , and it will please the spice faithful . \\nbut this sloppy enterprise surely won\\'t win them any new fans , which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states . \\nonce the hype disappears , spice world will likely serve as the the spices\\' final hurrah in america . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" the end of the affair \" is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs . \\nalthough it\\'s slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience . \\nbased on graham greene\\'s novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters . \\nthere\\'s maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile\\'s ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore ) . \\nsarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he\\'s just a normal guy . \\nit\\'s all work and no play with him . \\nwhile maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her . \\nunfortunately the two break up . \\nthis is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present . \\nit\\'s a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too . \\nwhile this may sound straight forward it\\'s not . \\nit\\'s a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men , unhappiness , and the ever lasting love . \\nall this may sound like a drag , but it really captures your interest . \\nwith great performances by ralph fiennes ( doing another english patient type of film , only this movie is better ) and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 , i believe this was the role , she had the most passion for , and you can see why . \\nthe story was also well written thanks to neil jordan . \\neven though i didn\\'t read the book , there\\'s no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive . \\nwhat\\'s so moving about it you ask ? \\nthe tragedy of it all . \\nit\\'s not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing . \\nit really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect . \\neveryone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces . \\nback to neil jordan\\'s script , it wasn\\'t only red roses . \\nthere were times when i felt it too be a little slow , but most romances are . \\nit also tended to be a bit confusing , especially at the start . \\nit keep jumping around from past to present , so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things . \\nalso a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan . \\ni\\'d have to say this is his finest achievement to date , because quite frankly i\\'ve never really found his work to be up to par . \\nit just never did anything for me , until now . \\nwhen it ends , it leaves viewers a little saddened , but provoked nonetheless . \\nthis is definitely one of the best films of 99 , and had some of the best acting , most notably by moore . \\nnot for all movie goers , but for those who are film buffs and want something of value . \\n',\n",
       " b\"plunkett & macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott , brother of ridley and tony . \\nnaturally , this got me worried . \\nwould jake's talent be inherited from ridley or tony ? \\nif it was from ridley , than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in . \\nif it was from tony , it would be wham bang drivel . \\nunfortunately , the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm . \\ncarlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen , plunkett ( carlyle ) who is poor and unruly , and captain james macleane ( miller ) a clean cut gentleman . \\nas the tagline clearly wants to make known , they rob the rich and nothing else . \\nthe film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage , along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca ( tyler . ) \\nhot on both their tails is mr chance ( ken stott ) who wants to see them both dead . \\nplunkett & macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose . \\nalthough undoubtedly slick and fast paced , there's very little merit contained in the film . \\ncarlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair , although their characters are criminally undeveloped . \\nit appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes , but not on the script . \\nthe five ( ! ) screenwriters ( three credited ) have produced an still born movie : there's very little development in the story . \\nalso , major events , such as mr . cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are , are so rushed that they barely happened . \\nthe story is a bit of a mess , frankly . \\nthe performances aren't bad : carlyle and miller are typical lads , but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest . \\nher irritable , stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb , and i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on . \\nshe looks nice , though . \\nmore interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester , and although his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character , he hams it up well . \\nken stott is suitably evil as chance , but again he is nothing but a flat character . \\ni didn't particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived . \\nalthough a disappointment in writing , and a minor success in acting , the film certainly look lavish , with good costumes , and wonderful sets . \\nbut production design alone can't save a movie , especially a movie as bad as this mess . \\njake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama : the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty , with 'f * ck this' and 'stand and f * cking deliver' splattered all over the place . \\nthe mtv editing and direction are flash enough , but in the end decidedly empty . \\nplunkett & macleane is a massive disappointment . \\nalthough somewhat enjoyable during parts , it's so light it could float off the screen if it wasn't just images on a reel . \\nthere's no thought , no development , no plot , just a series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen-xers . \\nalthough it's a great idea : update a period drama to the mtv generation : it's execution is awful , and would more likely bore than excite . \\nsloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless , it's hard to recommend plunkett & macleane as a movie , but easy to recommend it as a overlong music video . \\ngive it a miss . \\n\",\n",

\\nright ! \\nthe films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels . \\nhowever , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one . \\nhe gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that\\'s it . \\nmaybe some stunts . \\nfor all this , i can\\'t even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! \\nand when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say . \\ni think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode . \\ngeorge is in between them . \\nhe\\'s not quintessential , he\\'s not horrible , he\\'s good . \\nbut i\\'m sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they\\'ll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we\\'ll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) . \\nthe villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher . \\nlast time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey . \\nthis time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze . \\nwe feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ?

       " b'the following review encompasses two versions of dune : \\ndune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . \\nthe film\\'s visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . \\ndune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television . \\nit was disowned by director david lynch but it\\'s considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline . \\nquality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web . \\n * * * the review * * * \\nreleased in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert\\'s cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans . \\ndirector david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico . \\nthe screenplay was lynch\\'s own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected . \\ndune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors . \\nthe key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that\\'s home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange . \\nthe spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe . \\nit extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it . \\nmost importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to \" fold space \" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish . \\nlynch\\'s film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story\\'s two main strands . \\none is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis . \\nthe second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen . \\nthe deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom . \\nunfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended . \\nthe thinking among universal\\'s oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office . \\nwith lynch\\'s initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made . \\nwhat a great idea ! \\nwhy not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? \\nthe most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . \\nthus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul\\'s father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . \\nthe end result is a distinct chill : we can\\'t warm to most of the cast and we don\\'t care much for them . \\nand it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . \\ndune is also a very serous film . \\nthe constant \" self-talk \" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . \\nthe overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . \\nhumour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen\\'s mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . \\nyou may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus\\' star wars trilogy . \\nthe theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . \\nit still possesses enough of lynch\\'s stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . \\nspecial effects whiz carlo rambaldi\\'s giant sandworms are an awesome sight . \\nboth the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . \\nand the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . \\nwith these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis\\' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . \\nsee it in the widescreen format if you can . \\nand despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . \\nsian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who\\'s secret aim is to manipulate paul\\'s destiny for its own shadowy ends . \\nas paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . \\nthe conclusion ? \\nany assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert\\'s original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . \\ndavid lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . \\ndune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . \\nmany chose to stay away altogether , as the film\\'s disastrous box office showing attests . \\nthe extended version , however , is a rather different beast . \\nin 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition \" director\\'s cut \" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . \\nbut , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . \\nin a way , then , it is partly lynch\\'s own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . \\nstung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director\\'s guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with \" allen smithee \" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . \\nhe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous \" judas booth \" . \\ncertainly , looking at the results of mca\\'s handiwork there\\'s at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . \\nbut these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . \\nmost of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version\\'s storyline . \\npaul\\'s relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . \\nthe political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . \\npaul\\'s initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . \\nand as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . \\nas a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv\\'s version of dune is clearly superior . \\nas a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . \\nthe use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . \\nthere\\'s some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . \\nand the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . \\nships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . \\nthis is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . \\nit should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . \\nbut the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn\\'t even in herbert\\'s book . \\nthe scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his \" heart plug \" . \\nits a surreal and disturbing episode that\\'s very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . \\ndespite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . \\nall up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . \\nunless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the \" alan smithee \" version remains the closest we\\'ll get to what the movie should have been . \\non repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . \\nstill , as one of this century\\'s great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . \\nwith rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . \\n',\n",

       " b\"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nfloating life , australia's first-ever submission to the academy of motion picture arts & sciences for consideration in the best foreign language film category ( its dialogue is in cantonese , english , and german ) , marks a special accomplishment by clara law . \\na compelling , at times poignant film , it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama . \\nfloating life centers around a hong kong family's sense of dislocation and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong , and is divided into clearly defined vignettes , each chapter labelled with title cards pertaining to houses , which serves to emphasize the film's theme of family . \\nthe film opens with mr . and mrs . chan ( edwin pang , cecilia fong sing lee ) and their two teen sons ( toby wong , toby chan ) leaving the bustling , claustrophobic metropolis of hong kong to join their second daughter bing ( annie yip ) in australia . \\nwith their spacious , immaculately-white new house and the vast abundance of neighbourhood greenery , the chans initially find this serene new land a strange and wonderous one , and - with neurotic bing cooly remarking about the possible dangers of australian life ( killer dogs , poisonous spiders , dangerous ultraviolet rays ) - a frightening one . \\nthis sets up a wonderfully amusing scene early in the film where the four immigrants , aimlessly ambling about their new suburban neighbourhood , are sent scrambling by the yelps of a little white puppy . \\nthe tone set up early in the film is broadly comic , and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as the chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the new ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society ( a scene where the two teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling ) , but the film suddenly veers towards an introspective and melodramatic tone . \\nfloating life shifts its focus away from the exploits of the new immigrants and towards bing's domineering of her newly-reunited family , setting out a set of stringent and oppressive rules which create tremendous tension within the household and threaten to fracture the family . \\nmeanwhile , elder daughter yen ( annette shun wah ) , happily settled in germany with her husband and young daughter , begins to suffer an identity crisis , manifesting itself with her claims to her patiently exasperated husband that their new home is cursed with bad feng shui , and further exacerbated upon hearing of the familial conflict down under . \\namong the dramatic threads of floating life , this is perhaps the most effective and engaging , with an interesting set of characters and a storyline which generates a genuine emotional punch . \\nthe one misguided vignette in floating life involves eldest son gar ming ( anthony wong ) , left behind in hong kong to resolve various affairs on behalf of his family and to await his immigration papers before rejoining his parents and brothers in australia . \\nemotionally detatched and aimlessly drifting , his is an uncompelling character , and consequently subsequent attempts to draw out pathos are uninvolving and ineffective . \\nhis desperate search for emotional fulfillment is depicted by philosopical droning on the exquisite peak of an orgasm , which quickly becomes tedious . \\nms . law's film cheerfully embraces melodrama - each of the major vignettes feature excessively emotional climaxes which i couldn't help but find reminiscent to wayne wang's acutely unsubtle the joy luck club - but despite the director's rather clear attempts to tug at the heartstrings , i couldn't help but be touched by a powerful and affecting soliloquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee which truly packs an emotional wallop and , in dramatic terms , is certainly the highlight of floating life . \\nfloating life at times spreads itself too thin ; given the myriad of characters involved , it could either stand to delve into each vignette a little deeper , or narrow its focus to a select group of key characters . \\nhowever , it is a fine film , with a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by clara law and husband eddie ling-ching fong , and some superb acting by a cast consisting almost exclusively of non-actors ( special note is to be made of cecilia fong sing lee , annette shun wah , and a short but dazzling performance by an actress who portrayed gar ming's girlfriend from vancouver ) . \\nfloating life is ultimately about the ties that bond a family together , which are able to withstand great distances and new environments . \\n\",\n",

\\nas in the original film , \" toy story 2 \" contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there . \\nreportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters . \\nthe film is well worth seeing on the big screen . \\nthe colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more \" human . \" \\nthe animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . \\nthere are so many impressive sequences that i\\'d find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al\\' s toy barn , the store owned by woody\\'s captor . \\npixar\\'s rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . \\nthe voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development . \\ntom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . \\nit was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim . \\nall the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent . \\nseveral new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work . \\n \" toy story 2 \" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . \\nwoody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn\\'t yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like . \\nthe new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner . \\nit may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it\\'s downright touching . \\nthe script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it\\'s a sequel . \\nthe reason \" toy story 2 \" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original\\'s success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters . \\nnot this one . \\nwe get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up . \\n \" toy story 2 \" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . \\nthere is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . \\nthe humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults . \\nthere are funny asides to films such as \" star wars \" and \" jurassic park , \" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock \\'em sock \\'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts \" a bug\\'s life \" and the 1997 short \" geri \\'s game . \" \\n ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody\\'s broken arm . ) \\nthe action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better . \\n \" toy story 2 \" never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest . \\nthe more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is . \\nit\\'s rare to see a film like \" toy story 2 \" come along , because it\\'s the kind of film that\\'s almost impossible to dislike . \\nit\\'s created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it\\'s nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . \\nit\\'s a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing \" toy story 2 . \" it\\'s the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original . \\n',\n",

this seems enough to illustrate my point . \\nthis movie is really stupid . \\nit never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief . \\nalso , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston . \\nthe movie doesn\\'t just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four . \\na blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs . \\nshe\\'s of the \" new people \" ; they\\'re of the \" old people \" with \" the memories . \" \\nyep . \\nwe get it . \\nwe get it . \\nthe clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me . \\nthe movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing . \\nas stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time . \\nthe rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt . \\nthe face-painting that\\'s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind . \\nthis movie also suffers from its new age trappings . \\nmaybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music . \\nadd to this the film\\'s faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you\\'d expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious . \\nthe clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it\\'s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i\\'ve seen in quite a while . \\nit contains several scenes of sex sans nudity . \\nthe violence mostly consists of hunting scenes . \\nthe funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear . \\nthe bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about . \\nalthough this may sound gratuitous , i\\'m sure , it\\'s so cheesy that it probably won\\'t bother most people . \\nthe clan of the cave bear is a bad movie . \\nhowever , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality . \\ntypically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind . \\nthe clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it\\'s so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) . \\ni have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ;

       " b'let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years . \\ni am not too fond of ted turner\\'s world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight . \\nthe plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show . \\nwhen they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt . \\ni personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back . \\nwhen they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king\\'s real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv . \\nking is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king . \\nafter convincing king that they don\\'t care that his persona isn\\'t real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw\\'s pay-per-view . \\ngee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don\\'t know where to begin . \\nyes , i do . . . \\n1 . the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans . \\nhe thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously . \\nhe actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously . \\ni got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 ! \\ni know he\\'ll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn\\'t meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that\\'s how big an ego bischoff has . \\n2 . there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon\\'s screwing bret \" the hitman \" hart out of the title . \\nthis movie\\'s storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man\\'s wayne and garth thrown in . \\neric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart . \\n3 . \\nthe movie\\'s main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him . \\nno wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today ! \\n4 . why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ? \\ni know wrestling isn\\'t a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end . \\n5 . \\nin the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan . \\nwhat she sees in that freak marilyn manson i\\'ll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king\\'s trainer for sinclair . \\nwouldn\\'t it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ? \\ni hate that . \\n6 . \\nlast , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either . \\nthe world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons : \\n1 . they\\'re the better promotion . \\n2 . they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers . \\n3 . \\nthey give their fans what they want and don\\'t treat them like idiots . \\n4 . they\\'re winning the ratings and they\\'re the promotion everybody cares about . \\n5 . simply put , they could make a movie a hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way . \\nthe only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end . \\nand if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars . \\n',\n",

\\nchicken pies , of course . \\nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \\nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \\npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park\\'s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \\n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \\nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \\nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \\nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \\nthing is , the film doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \\npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \\npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \\nbut they\\'re * chickens * , so it\\'s funny to us . \\nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park\\'s films ) succeed is the animators\\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\\'re cribbing . \\nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \\nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \\nthere\\'s even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\\'s nationality and film history . \\nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \\nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \\nconsider this : since july of last year , i\\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \\nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \\nwhy ? \\nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they\\'re parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch\\' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \\nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \\nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn\\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \\nif you\\'ve never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \\neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \\npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\\'s understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \\nenjoyment of this movie doesn\\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\\'ve got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \\nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \\nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \\nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \\nthe characters\\' inevitable romance doesn\\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \\npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\\'t any help . \\njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \\nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \\none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \\nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \\nthe animation is first-rate . \\nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \\nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \\nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug\\'s life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \\ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\\'ll catch all the details . \\nanyway , the movie\\'s just a boatload of fun . \\nfunnest damn movie i\\'ve seen all year . \\n',\n",

       " b'logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility . \\nconsidering that the skeptic\\'s best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task . \\noccasionally , we get a film that does manage it . \\nterry gilliam\\'s \" 12 monkeys \" was one such film . \\nbut more frequently , we get films that don\\'t much deal with it at all . \\nthere is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? \\nthe \" terminator \" films made up for them with exciting action , \" back to the future \" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film \" frequency \" pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own . \\nis \" frequency \" filled with plot holes ? \\nyes . \\ndoes it matter ? \\nnot really . \\nthe film opens in october of 1969 . \\nfirefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . \\nthe double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . \\na strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in \\'69 and that john has found in the present day . \\nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . \\nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . \\nfrank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . \\nthe premise of \" frequency \" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . \\nthis isn\\'t explained ; you just have to go with it . \\nwhen frank doesn\\'t die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . \\nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . \\nsometimes frank\\'s changing the past results in something happening right away in john\\'s world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . \\nnow , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer\\'s murders was because the change had already happened in frank\\'s world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren\\'t really the point . \\nwhen \" frequency \" gets cooking , it\\'s a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . \\nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and \" frequency \" works as long as it keeps moving . \\nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . \\ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure \" frequency \" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . \\ni liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . \\nit actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin\\' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john\\'s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . \\n ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) \\ni even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . \\nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let\\'s face it : it\\'s a darn cool way to end the film . \\nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in \" frequency \" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . \\nthe other major thing to appreciate about \" frequency \" is the handling of the father-son relationship . \\nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it\\'s a rock-solid job from both actors . \\nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? \\nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . \\nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don\\'t believe in the characters , we don\\'t care about the outcome of the thriller plot . \\nhere , we do care , because we like the lead actors . \\ni also liked some of the supporting cast members . \\nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . \\nandre braugher , late of the television show \" homicide : life on the street , \" gives a nice supporting turn as frank\\'s best friend and future colleague of john . \\nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank\\'s world series predictions come true before his very eyes . \\nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . \\nperhaps the only thing i didn\\'t like about \" frequency \" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera\\'s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . \\nbut that\\'s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . \\ni freely acknowledge that \" frequency \" may best work as a \" guy \" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of \" field of dreams \" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . \\nwho wouldn\\'t want to speak with a long-dead parent ? \\nor see how their children turn out ? \\n \" tell me about your life , son \" -- excuse me while i mist up . \\nand don\\'t call me a sissy . \\n',\n",
       " b'remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? \\n \" pulp fiction \" and \" fargo \" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter . \\nthat fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing \" the way of the gun \" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be\\'s but upon closer inspection doesn\\'t look like anything comprehendable . \\nit\\'s a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won\\'t allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous . \\ncomplexity should come as no surprise to anyone who\\'s familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote \" the usual suspects , \" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim . \\nthat film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings . \\nyou have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that \" if it\\'s really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . \" \\nwith \" the way of the gun \" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped . \\nthe film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren\\'t hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) . \\nthey get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization . \\nthey figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom . \\nalong the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the \" bag man \" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he\\'s doing ) . \\nthe exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can\\'t call the authorities for help . \\nhis goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers\\' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back . \\nthe exec\\'s son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right . \\nmeanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all . \\nmcquarrie doesn\\'t know the meaning of the word simple . \\nhe seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie . \\neverything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it\\'s to the point of surrealism . \\nnothing is what it seems in this reality , it\\'s one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry\\'s rules and regulations . \\nevery scene with caan\\'s character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about \" the business \" and how it works and we\\'re hardly given a clue as to what they\\'re talking about . \\nthese characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they\\'re more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet\\'s trash . \\nno one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality . \\nit\\'s like a dream without any appeal . \\ntake the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff . \\nthey sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don\\'t move . \\nthe guy and his loud-mouth , potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them . \\nyou\\'d think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don\\'t , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob . \\nthere\\'s a lot of things i didn\\'t understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn\\'t some yuppie or old rich snob , he\\'s like a hippie straight out of the 60s . \\nsecondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . \\nlastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country\\'s army . \\nif they were suicidal they wouldn\\'t have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) . \\nthere\\'s a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . \\nwhat it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is . \\nabsolutely none of the characters are likable or believable . \\nand it\\'s all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . \\nwith any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it . \\ni can\\'t say either for \" the way of the gun , \" because it has very little going for it and i can\\'t imagine anyone intelligently defending it . \\n',\n",

\\nhow did civilization change so rapidly ? \\neveryone has horses : where did all they come from ? \\nthe \" law of eights \" that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film , but where ? \\nare we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn\\'t made their way west to help or conquer ? \\nthere is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn\\'t appear to make sense . \\nthe tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments , but beyond that there are some oddities . \\nthe evil army is called \" holnists \" which sounds coincidentally like the new age \" holism \" , but why ? \\nis it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 , just one year after many ancient prophesies ( including the ending of the mayan calendar ) predict a new world for mankind ? \\nwhy is the general named \" bethlehem \" ? \\nthere seems to be some reason for that , but what ? \\nsometimes the movie feels like a joke . \\nan army of postal workers armed with guns ? \\nconsidering the headlines of recent years , it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys . \\nit\\'s even more difficult to accept those re-powering the federal government as the heroes . \\ngiven the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government , it\\'s asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film\\'s nationalism . \\neven with its numerous flaws , the movie all comes together , if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have . \\nit\\'s doubtful that \" the postman \" is going to find much of an audience , but a few of us are going to have a good time . \\nbesides we\\'re all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug . \\n ( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the \" michael redman \" arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is , to the best of his knowledge , not him . \\nperhaps this similarly-named person should have used kevin costner\\'s postal service . ) \\n',\n",
       " b'_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction . \\nif you haven\\'t heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven\\'t seen it -- well , i suspect you\\'re in a small minority ! \\nfirst thing\\'s first ? is it all it\\'s hyped up to be ? \\nwell , yes ? and no . \\nit\\'s a good film , and there\\'s a lot to like about it , but it\\'s not without its problems . \\nwhen i saw the first trailer for \" titanic \" , it was when i went to see \" bean \" last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain\\'t that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? ! \\ni mean , what\\'s happened to hollywood\\'s script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ? \\ngads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ? \\ni was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn\\'t alone in that respect . \\nit\\'s when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who\\'d been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice ! \\ni didn\\'t see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , \\nso i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn\\'t think i\\'d enjoy it much . \\ndid i ? yes and no . \\nmainly yes , i\\'m happy to say . \\nthe first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i\\'ll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron\\'s directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the \" human \" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting . \\nthe film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a\\' course ! \\n : - ) ) . \\nwell , it\\'s an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat . \\ndoes it work here ? \\nin script form it doesn\\'t add all that much to the story . \\nwhat does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film . \\nher presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her . \\nalso impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving . \\nit\\'s an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack\\'s \" rescuing \" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching . \\nin fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance . \\nit\\'s engaging , touching and very enjoyable . \\nthere\\'s more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it\\'s not going to be a happy ending . \\nwhich leads us to the second half of the film . \\nwe all knew it was coming . \\ni\\'m sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he\\'s stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film . \\ni think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die . \\nthe iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour . \\nand it is an hour . \\nmy goodness , we don\\'t miss a second of that hour ? \\ngratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today\\'s standards , i\\'m sure there\\'s been far worse produced under the banner of \" entertainment \" in other films . \\nbut i certainly wasn\\'t prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be . \\nnot that i\\'d expect the word \" understatement \" to be part of cameron\\'s vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as \" terminator 2 \" and \" aliens \" ) . \\nis it overdone ? \\ni thought so . \\nunderstatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy . \\nno , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn\\'t quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film\\'s second half . \\nstill , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears ! \\nyou really couldn\\'t help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose\\'s overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive . \\nperhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface . \\nthe bit where rose lets go of jack\\'s hand , while promising she\\'ll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it . \\ni loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half . \\nso , we\\'ve established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive . \\nhaven\\'t mentioned the script . \\nplot-wise it\\'s ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i\\'ve a feeling that\\'s to the actors credit if anything . \\nas for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 . \\nit\\'s a period drama . \\nbut i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned . \\ndid they really use phrases like \" goddamn it ! \" \\nback in the turn of the century ? \\ni doubt it . \\nwould someone talk like this : \" do ya love the guy or what ? \" . \\ni doubt it . \\nis such dialogue as \" i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now \" not just a bit ? clumsy ? \\nyes it is . \\na little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) . \\nstick with directing , dude . \\nbut its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast . \\nstar of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn\\'t she win that oscar ? ! \\nafter all , they were throwing oscars at \" titanic \" left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee . \\ndirecting-wise cameron does a spectacular job . \\nlike i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well . \\ni haven\\'t even mentioned james horner\\'s beautiful score . \\nutterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it ! \\n ; - ) \\ni\\'ve finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would ! \\njust leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ? \\nhell , don\\'t talk to me about oscars . \\nbloomin\\' farce . \\nit was deserving in a number of departments , though . \\nlast question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ? \\nnope , i don\\'t think so . \\nit\\'s certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i\\'ve ever seen , but i don\\'t think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites . \\nand as for the fact they\\'re reportedly making a \" titanic 2 \" ? well i guess that\\'s typical hollywood for you ! \\n',\n",

       " b\"martin scorsese's kundun , which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama , has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure . \\npersonally , i don't think it needs one : it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china . \\nscorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do , as a larger-than-life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership : the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences , but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal . \\nthe set design and cinematography are outstanding , and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle , it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao . \\npolitical art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans , kundun does not : it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative . \\n\",\n",

) \\napril\\'s parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way . \\nthe bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the \" circuitry \" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it . \\nmr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own . \\ni\\'m not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs . \\neither way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie . \\nthe film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about \" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews \" . \\nif harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can\\'t help but feel like he had some serious intent . \\nas for the entire central theme of the movie , i\\'m afraid that it\\'s one that i just don\\'t get . \\ni tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes . \\nit was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society . \\nhow does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? \\ni\\'m not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don\\'t force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren\\'t going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me . \\nagain , maybe i\\'m missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully . \\nas far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy . \\ndespite the disturbing visuals , \" mom and apple pie \" stuck with me for the rest of the day . \\nspeaking of disturbing visuals , \" wedding bells ain\\'t ringing \" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying . \\n \" i\\'m a lesbian \" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith . \\nit\\'s mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based . \\nthe other performers are decent , save for the rosie o\\'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan . \\ni have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired . \\none particular musical number , \" lesbian rock \" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan . \\nthe film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll . \\nthe remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( \" lesbian rock \" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film . \\nonce the \" isle of lesbos reprise \" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all . \\nwhy was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ? \\nisle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie-underground . com . \\nthe transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 . \\nin many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) . \\nthis film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it . \\nif you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out . \\ni , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . . \\nwait . aren\\'t gladiator films considered to be . . . \\noh , never mind . \\n',\n",

       " b'after 1993\\'s \" falling down , \" i hoped that joel schumacher would mature into a great director . \\nsince then he has offered us two so-so adaptations of john grisham novels ( \" the client \" and \" a time to kill \" ) and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise . \\nalthough these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher\\'s potential , the publicity for his latest release , \" 8mm , \" raised new hope . \\nit promised to be something unusual . \\nit wasn\\'t . \\nthe plot goes like this : tom welles ( nicolas cage ) is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman , allegorically named mrs . christian ( myra carter ) , to investigate an 8mm movie found among her late husband\\'s belongings . \\nthe movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a man in a leather mask ( who reminds me of bane in schumacher\\'s \" batman & robin \" ) . \\nbecause murders can be realistically simulated in movies , mrs . christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead . \\nby combing through missing persons reports , tom finds the girl\\'s name and tracks her to los angeles . \\nwith the aid of max california ( joaquin phoenix ) , a video store clerk ( and another symbolic name ) , tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff . \\nthe plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schrader\\'s \" hardcore , \" in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter . \\nboth films are modeled on dante\\'s \" the inferno , \" of course ; \" 8mm \" makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil . \\n \" hardcore \" is a much more subtle and meaningful film . \\n \" 8mm \" had a lot of promise . \\nin its better moments it\\'s an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom . \\none moment of the first sort : when we first meet max he\\'s reading truman capote\\'s \" in cold blood \" underneath the cover of a porn novel . \\n \" in cold blood \" was the father of the true-crime genre , which is the literary equivalent of snuff films . \\nmax promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom , \" dance with the devil and the devil don\\'t change ; the devil changes you . \" \\ntom does change-i\\'ll let you discover the specifics for yourself-but not permanently . \\nschumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker didn\\'t have the guts to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldn\\'t come back . \\n ( walker\\'s \" seven \" did a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise ) . \\ncage tries hard to pull it off , but the script doesn\\'t give him enough to work with . \\nphoenix walks away with the movie-he\\'s smart , charming , and funny . \\nother cast members include \" fargo \" \\'s peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and \" the sopranos \" \\'s james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far . \\nin the last analysis , since \" 8mm \" falls short of its pretensions and its promise , its just another private eye story in the raymond chandler/ross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege . \\nhowever , unlike other predictable fare in the genre-last year\\'s \" twilight , \" for example- \" 8mm \" is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is . \\n',\n",
       " b'i\\'m not really sure what to think about \" crash . \" \\non the surface , it\\'s a cold , boring , unerotic porn with name starts , a name director , and some cool camerawork . \\ni mean , it left me completely bored , unsatisfied , and generally kinda weirded out . \\nbut then again , not every film\\'s supposed to leave you entertained . \\n \" crash \" is structured to play like a porn flick , but with significantly more plot and dialogue . \\nwhile we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex , we also have a skimpy little plot going on ( mostly towards the beginning ) , and maybe just a hair of characterization . \\nnot to mention the acting is generally pretty good , and we don\\'t really see a lot of the actors completely exposed . \\nbut what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience . \\nthis film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of \" henry and june \" or the just plain horniness of , say , \" deep throat \" ( not that i\\'ve seen it ) . \\nif one was to be made completely hot by this film , it would probably mean they were also into the whole \" auto eroticism \" thing . \\nthe film leaves you cold erotically ( and maybe in many other ways ) , but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge . \\nthe film opens up on a woman , catherine ( deborah kara ungar , of \" the game \" ) , pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar . \\nsuddenly , a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind ( the film doesnt\\' show all this though , even if it is nc-17 ) . \\nthe next scene has a film director , james ( james spader ) , having sex with a camera woman ( alice poon ) in an office on the highly-populated set of his movie . \\nthe next scene has the two coming together , revealing to us that they\\'re husband and wife , and them sharing in one another\\'s escapades . \\nwhile the two are arguably freaky people , we at least know they love to live on the edge . \\nsoon afterwards , james is driving down the road at night , reclessly of course ( he\\'s reading something ) , when he drifts into the other lane , and then hits another car face on . \\njames is not killed , but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat ( obviously dying ) , leaving the driver , helen remington ( holly hunter - in a porn ? ) , also alive . \\nthe two go through therapy together , and when getting out , they run into eachother again . \\nwhen james gives her a ride home , they almost get into another accident , and immeadiately afterwards , they go to an unbusy parking lot , and have a little quickie , as they were aroused by the accident . \\nyou wouldn\\'t think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish , but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan ( elias kosteas ) and his crutch-carrying girlfriend , gabrielle ( rosanna arquette ) , who are also into it . \\nvaughan is into living on the edge as they are , but he takes it to another level : he loves to recreate famous car crashes . \\nin one scene , he and a friend , colin seagrave ( peter macneill ) recreate james dean\\'s car crash without any padding or safety belts , and suffer some concussions , but nevertheless get a rush ( and the attention of the police ) . \\nsoon , these five are all having sex with one another , be it straight , gay , or lesbian sex . \\nwhile this is admittingly all a bit comical ( the film is almost like a black comedy ) , the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who\\'s main fetish is living on the edge . \\ni\\'m sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents , but i personally don\\'t see a connection between car crashes and sex . \\nthe main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush . \\nhis car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini-masterpieces : we\\'re at first not sure if they\\'ll take place , but everytime it looks like it may occur , we gasp . \\nthen when it happens , we hold our breath . \\nthe same thing happens with sex , although not in the same fashion . \\nthese people are merely taking it to another level . \\nthe only problem with the film is that it\\'s a tad redundant . \\na normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half . \\nthis goes on for about 100 minutes , and it just seems a little too long . \\nthe sex and car crashes are far between one another , and the time between them are a tad on the boring side . \\nthere\\'s no characterization , although it could definitely be argued , that hey , it\\'s a porn , and we\\'re not here to sympathize . \\nbut still , they coulda cut it down a bit . \\nbut the film is saved with its presentation , as well as some other elements . \\nthe atmosphere is very dark and forboding , creating a kind of cool weird feeling . \\nand there are several scenes are just amazing . \\none scene has catherine and james having sex , while she softly asks him questions about being with a man , which sounds almost erotic the way she says it . \\na sequence involving one character\\'s death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs . \\nand the final shot is shot perfectly , creating an image of a car crash , and a couple having sex in front of it , despite the fact that she\\'s wounded . \\nthe acting is also pretty good , especially for what is almost a porn ( ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn ) . \\nwhile james spader is pretty boring ( he\\'s usually pretty intense ) , deborah kara ungar is amazing . \\nshe speaks all her words in almost zombie-like hushes , and when she\\'s having sex , she has a blank look on her face , not showing the viewer whether she\\'s enjoying it or not . \\nin one scene , she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her . \\nholly hunter , who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this , is pretty good , and so is rosanna arquette ( who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role ) . \\nbut the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone . \\nhe often speaks as he is out of breath , showing a definite affinity for his way of life . \\nhe has a great deal of energy in several scenes , especially one scene where he\\'s taking photographs of a picture , and a later scene where he\\'s getting a freaky tatoo . \\nhe and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes , foreshadowing a later scene . \\nkosteas is a little known actor ( his biggest role was casey jones in \" teenage mutant ninja turtles \" ) , but here he shows a deniro-like presence , hinting that he\\'s capable of bigger roles . \\nwhile i hardly enjoyed \" crash , \" it\\'s still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who , if the exist , are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world . \\nthese people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities , and the film , which doesn\\'t exactly pain them in a negative light , is sucessful in bringing them to light , even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out . \\ndespite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc-17 rating ( there\\'s also an r-rated version , but i wouldn\\'t even go near that thing ) , anyone looking for a quick turn-on should just rent a regular porno . \\n',\n",
       " b'cradle will rock is the latest effort from director/actor tim robbins . \\nwhile he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 ( dead man walking ) , he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here . \\nthe story is confusing , and filled with many subplots , so i\\'ll try my best and explain it as simply as possible . \\nthe film is based on a \" mostly \" true story about a federal theater in the 1930s , that produced a play ( the cradle will rock ) that apparently was offensive to some , so the government shuts it down . \\nit\\'s during the time of the depression , and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs , or are poor . \\nbetween this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots , about those who work in theater , or those associated . \\nalso along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience . \\ntim robbin\\'s just keeps piling on political views , and characters , that we just give up on the film , or in some cases walk out . \\nfor robbin\\'s it may be a nice achievement , but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue , and fancy outfits . \\ni thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast , unfortunately are all uninteresting , except for a few . \\nlet me recap what each important character does , so please bear with me ( it\\'s the least you can do , especially if you were considering seeing this ) . \\ni\\'ll begin with those involved with the play . \\nthere\\'s orson welles ( angus macfadyen ) who of course is the director of the play , the producer john houseman ( cary elwes ) , marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) the writer of the play , emily watson , a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock . \\noutside the play there\\'s the : ventriloquist ( bill murray ) who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk ( joan cusack ) , another subplot involving a painter diego rivera ( ruben blades ) who\\'s unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage ( john cusack ) . \\nthere\\'s a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories ( susan sarandon , philip baker hall too name a few ) but those that i mentioned , were the most significant to the story . \\nanyway , most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted , except for emily watson , who does another great job , and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack , who always delivers through thick and thin . \\nnow although most of the film was weak to say the least , there were some nice moments and some involving subjects , but all this is overblown . \\nsure the free speech segment was a nice feature , but not when it becomes repetitive . \\nthe whole film is like this , and it\\'s basically nothing but a headache . \\non the brighter side , tim robbin\\'s direction was masterful . \\nhis camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson\\'s latest magnolia , only smoother in my opinion , but even that can\\'t make a movie that much better . \\nalthough it has it\\'s moments ( not many of them , but they\\'re there ) , cradle will rock stays true to it\\'s title , because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over . \\n',\n",
       " b'if you\\'re going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke , why bother releasing it to the general public ? \\nif you\\'re going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ? \\nwhile watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people . \\nwhat he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation . \\ncelebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he\\'s familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows . \\nallen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more . \\nbranagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery . \\nthe usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another . \\nunless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it\\'s not likely that you\\'ll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity . \\naside from all the in-jokes , the story falls far short of compelling , and the characters are all empty and lifeless . \\nbranagh proves once again that he\\'s a superb performer , nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly . \\nthe problem is that he\\'s the same character allen always plays , a character who\\'s getting more than a little dull to watch . \\ni mean , come on , how many times have you seen this guy ? \\n-- he hates his work , and he can\\'t be satisfied by any one woman , and , at the end of the movie , nothing has been solved . \\nhe brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he\\'s receiving fellatio , and other such stunts ) , so it\\'s pretty hard to care about him . \\nin addition , isn\\'t allen capable of creating characters who aren\\'t just like him ? \\ni know he is , but he didn\\'t do it in celebrity . \\nthe vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances . \\ndavis , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry , has a few touching moments , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie . \\nsome of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder , especially -- but they\\'re not likable people . \\nonly famke janssen , as a book editor interested in simon\\'s new novel , has any life . \\nthe men in the picture don\\'t do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin , while dicaprio , as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor , is funny but disengaging . \\nwhat\\'s really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its \" themes \" are . \\nallen seems to think that he\\'s making an insightful movie about the way \" normal \" people look at celebrities . \\nthe main problem with this is that the character with whom we\\'re supposed to identify , simon , is not a \" normal \" guy -- he\\'s just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters . \\nthe other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic , interesting characters ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue . \\nin addition , allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( robin , in this scene , says something like , \" it\\'s interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ! \" ) . \\ncelebrity is arguably allen\\'s biggest misfire to date . \\nit does have a few good scenes -- theron\\'s super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny , and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two . \\nbut celebrity is a failure at the core , unless allen\\'s point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends . \\nif he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke , then he succeeded in that . \\ni , for one , don\\'t enjoy feeling like an outsider . \\n',\n",
       " b'bruce willis and sixth sense director m . night shyamalan re-team to tell the story of david dunne ( willis ) , a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child . \\non a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job , dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of . \\nto make things even stranger , dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed . \\na comic book art dealer named elijah price ( samuel l . jackson ) , who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly , has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life . \\nprice felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him . . . \\nsomeone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break . \\nprice contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child . \\ndunne doesn\\'t believe him at first , but price assists him in discovering his \" powers \" and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is . \\nwriter/director m . night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense . \\nhow exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ? \\nfor shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners . \\ndoes this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? \\nthe answer to that question is not a very easy one , either . \\nas far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable . \\nit wasn\\'t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached . \\nfor unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before . \\nthe story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan\\'s direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving . \\nthere are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis\\' character and another train passenger . \\nthe shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak . \\nalso very impressive is the film\\'s score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan\\'s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year\\'s dinosaur ) . \\nseveral of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film . \\none of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to \" exercise \" his powers . \\nthe music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie . \\nif there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it . \\nthe film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment . \\nwillis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can\\'t seem to figure out why he\\'s been depressed for the last few years . \\nhis character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah\\'s tutelage . \\njackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah . \\nthough his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked . \\nrobin wright penn\\'s role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character\\'s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again . \\nspencer treat clark , as the dunne\\'s young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film . \\nout of all the characters , jeremy\\'s is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role . \\nwhere the film does lose points though , is during its \" surprise \" ending . \\nshyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying \" that was it ? ! \" \\nwhen unbreakable revealed its own ending . \\nit\\'s not that the ending is bad , it\\'s just that the ending doesn\\'t quite have the emotional punch that the other film\\'s did . \\nplus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won\\'t reveal the ending here , but you\\'ll understand what i mean when you see it ) . \\nessentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable . \\nthe only real problem is that the ending doesn\\'t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor . \\nas long as it isn\\'t held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film . \\none thing seems clear , though . \\nshyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film . \\n',\n",

\" , \\nbut \" can she help me get on a lifeboat ? \" \\ndicaprio is a revelation . \\ni hadn\\'t seen him before in anything , and didn\\'t know what the heck to expect , really . \\n ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . ) \\ndicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it\\'s hard not to like him . \\nfrom the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters . \\nwinslet\\'s character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance . \\nat first , she\\'s not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop-dead gorgeous . \\nwe know from the narration that she\\'s monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there isn\\'t any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio . \\nwinslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg . \\nit\\'s at that moment where winslet\\'s character really comes alive . \\nfaced with real danger , she drops her spoiled-rich-girl mannerisms and does a splendid job . \\nas rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal\\'s fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror . \\nof course , the most interesting character is the ship itself . \\ncameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain\\'s table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead . \\ncameron\\'s greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well . \\n',\n",
       " b'some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing - that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies . \\nthat is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don\\'t tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film . \\nsuch rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in . \\nsomething like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c . scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community . \\none day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california . \\nvan dorn is worried because he doesn\\'t believe that his daughter would run from home . \\nhowever , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film . \\ninfuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast\\'s investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself . \\nunfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless . \\nthings change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley ) . \\nalmost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars . \\nit is a real shame , because very few movies in today\\'s hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt . \\nin late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience . \\nfor schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s . \\non one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great . \\nbut that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons . \\nthe new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so-called \" sexual revolution \" , same as all other \" revolutions \" of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity . \\ninstead of being \" liberated \" , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms . \\nschrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren\\'t so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job . \\nthe difference between the two is simply in the line of work . \\nmany contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda . \\non the surface , it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest . \\nin the first scenes , he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn\\'t deserve to experience parent\\'s worst nightmare . \\nthe scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen\\'s fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation , brought by oscar-winning actor george c . scott , is of such intensity , that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda . \\nvan dorn is perhaps flawed , and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just , and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body . \\non the other hand , schrader , who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn\\'s ( his own parents wouldn\\'t allow him to watch movies until he was 18 ) , knows better and tries to bring another side of coin . \\neven the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky , who actually tries to improve her life , and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end . \\nunfortunately , schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning , and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale . \\nthe script is slightly flawed , and schrader as director doesn\\'t show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver . \\napart from the scenes in grand rapids , those two films even look alike . \\nbut the content might be more than interesting for today\\'s viewer , especially those inspired by the current 70s revival . \\nuntil boogie nights , no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s . \\nhardcore , on the other hand , might serve as precious document , because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video , when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists . \\nthe view of such age and the industry is very unflattering , though , but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience , that shouldn\\'t be too surprising . \\nanyway , despite some flaws , hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema . \\n',\n",
       " b'you know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man . \\nwhile watching instinct , i couldn\\'t help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies . \\neven beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn\\'t a very good film . \\nit\\'s painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly . \\ni didn\\'t hate it -- it\\'s simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good . \\nbut i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved . \\ni can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it\\'s pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams . \\nthings start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) . \\ncaulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous . \\nthe subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years . \\npowell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it\\'s now caulder\\'s job to find out of he\\'s mentally competent enough to stand trial . \\nthrough a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell . \\neven though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting . \\nas i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he\\'s on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he\\'s not acting , that he\\'s actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas . \\nthe character himself isn\\'t very interesting -- he\\'s just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action . \\ngooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual . \\nthe screenplay , written by gerald di pego and \" suggested by \" a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he\\'s obsessed with his work ) . \\nnonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct . \\nunfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting . \\nturtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct\\'s artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots . \\nfirst , we have the prison warden subplot . \\nthe prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder\\'s progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that\\'s fine . \\nthere\\'s also the prison guard subplot . \\nthe prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he\\'s instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion . \\nthen there\\'s the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man . \\nif some of this stuff sounds familiar , that\\'s because they\\'re all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films . \\nthe evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here . \\nthe offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo\\'s nest had . \\nashton\\'s evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown\\'s in the shawshank redemption . \\nhopkins\\' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs . \\nand then there\\'s the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film . \\nperhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth . \\nthe message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are \" takers , \" that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas . \\ni can sympathize with that , but only when it\\'s in a compelling film . \\nthis is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards . \\nwhat does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ? \\nif all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today . \\nif the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn\\'t rely on the strength of its actors . \\n',\n",

social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood\\'s financial and technical resources to create serious , \" personal \" or \" artsy \" movies . \\nas a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn\\'t want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen . \\ngeorge lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue . \\nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood . \\nserious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of \" blockbuster \" philosophy . \\none of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre . \\nuntil 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain . \\nin late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn\\'t look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey . \\nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies . \\nhowever , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn\\'t like it . \\nas a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s . \\nafter that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment . \\nironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of \" new hollywood \" generation of young movie authors who made \" artsy \" and \" personal \" films in early 1970s . \\ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti . \\nboth movies were considered \" personal \" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular . \\nin a sense , star wars is an also very \" personal \" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it . \\nbut unlike many \" personal \" movies of the era , its \" personality \" was in line with the wishes of the general audience . \\nthe plot , set \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far away \" , begins in a time of civil war . \\nthe evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic . \\nin order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets . \\nthe information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser . \\nprincess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker ) . \\nthose two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot . \\nhis adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness ) . \\nold man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force . \\nafter some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force . \\ntheir small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) . \\ncritics who don\\'t like the movie , especially those who can\\'t forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of \" new hollywood \" , are prone to point the lack of originality . \\non the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa\\'s samurai classic the hidden fortress . \\non the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) . \\nthe others would find the author\\'s element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes . \\neven out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art . \\ngeorge lucas\\' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup . \\ncharacters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster . \\nwe have a \" coming-of-age \" hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters . \\nsome of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form . \\nunfortunately , the same can\\'t be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career . \\nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology . \\noften comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground-breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas\\' superiority over kubrick . \\nhowever , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren\\'t the most remembered trademark of the movie . \\nthat honour should definitely go to the \" oscar \" -winning soundtrack by john williams , whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career . \\nnewer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release . \\nyet , even if they are immune to the george lucas\\' magic they should watch this film nevertheless , perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture . \\n',\n",
       " b'why do so many children\\'s films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? \\ntoo many of those who write or direct for children\\'s movies assume that the kids just can\\'t handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues . \\n \" the iron giant , \" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as \" the simpsons \" and \" king of the hill , \" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time . \\n \" the iron giant \" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that\\'s enjoyable for both children and adults alike . \\nhogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine . \\nafter staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception . \\nhe comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food . \\nafter saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts . \\nbecause of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy . \\nrealizing he can\\'t just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time . \\nit soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can\\'t keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security . \\nhe suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth\\'s house as a lodger . \\nmeanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind . \\n \" the iron giant \" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn\\' t talk down to its audience . \\nthe story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy . \\nit\\'s very similar to the spielberg classic \" e . t . , \\' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of \" the iron giant . \" \\nthe film holds many of the better elements of spielberg\\'s film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy . \\nthe film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one\\'s ability to choose one\\'s own fate . \\nhogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero . \\nthe final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won\\'t give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed . \\nthe animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after \" tarzan \" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you\\'re watching a cartoon . \\nthe giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way . \\nthe characters\\' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . \\nfine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother . \\nharry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv\\'s \" frasier \" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . \\nunlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn\\'t ditched ) . \\ndean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . \\neven the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . \\na lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won\\'t mind , but \" the iron giant \" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . \\nthe film isn\\'t only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though . \\nit\\'s also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . \\nthe scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on \" the simpsons \" for many years . \\na sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to \" outlast \" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . \\nthe film even takes some jabs at america\\'s nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to \" duck and cover \" in the event of a nuclear attack . \\n \" the iron giant \" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . \\ninstead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . \\nwhen you get right down to it , \" the iron giant \" is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . \\nthe story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . \\nthough i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . \\nit\\'s akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it\\'s not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which \" the iron giant \" has in spades . \\n',\n",

oscar nominations . \\ndescribing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can\\'t say much or you spoil it for everyone else . \\ni will tread lightly . \\njackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport . \\nthe camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation . \\nwe are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers . . . \\nfor a hefty price . \\nms . brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away . \\nhowever , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l . a . cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money . \\nthey try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell\\'s buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead . \\nthey try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing . \\nbut after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell\\'s friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail . \\nordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops . \\nafter she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison . \\nordell doesn\\'t like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track . \\nthis scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal . \\nrevealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that\\'s the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film . \\ntarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably . \\nhis hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way . \\nthey talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends . \\nof course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise . \\nand perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop . \\nof course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it . \\nthings are told from one person\\'s perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more . \\nthis all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side . \\non the technical side of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film . \\nhowever , this time around it isn\\'t as nearly as impressive or original . \\nthe writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino\\'s use of slang terms offensive . \\nthe story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it\\'s much more easy to understand . \\nhis previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to follow , especially considering that the time is given during the \" leaps \" in time . \\nperhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel \" rum punch \" by elmore leonard . \\nthe dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are fully realized . \\nthe cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good . \\nand as with pulp fiction , the music is a highlight , bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s . \\nthe acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable . \\nthe performances are incredibly rich , with hidden meaning behind every characters\\' actions . \\nnothing is quite as it seems , and you can\\'t really tell which side one person is on . \\nthe real treat , of course , is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown . \\nher poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which play an important role in the film . \\nwatching grieg , i could tell what was going through her mind , even if i didn\\'t know what she was thinking . \\nher face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought . \\nbridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato . \\ni didn\\'t even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham\\'s in boogie nights ) . \\nmichael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen . \\nchris tucker has a small , but effective performance . \\nsamuel l . jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . \\nbut no matter . . . \\njackson is very strong in his role . \\nrobert de niro is actually a little annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell\\'s perspective clients and friends . \\nrobert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most developed characters . \\nhe is present throughout most of the film , and he holds his own against jackson and grier . \\njackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks . \\nas a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment , with a complex plot to draw viewers in . \\nhowever , one can not help but compare it to tarantino\\'s pulp fiction , and expect great results . \\nwhen compared , it comes up short , but not that short . \\nit\\'s a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino . \\nperhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress . \\ni can\\'t remember seeing her in anything ( except for a small role in mars attacks ! ) , but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one . \\nexpect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations ( and hopefully she will even be able to nab one ) . \\n',\n",
       " b'the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects , a few well- paced action sequences , and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing . \\nhowever , it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel . \\nand , considering the quality of species 2 , it\\'s obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead . \\nthe only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is . \\nif you throw away the plot , which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence , logic , coherence , and consistency , species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience . \\nof course , that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys ( who , at least in theory , shouldn\\'t be able to get into an \" r \" -rated film ) and connoisseurs of bad movies . \\nthere\\'s enough blood , gore , simulated sex , and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring . \\nthis is a grade z exploitation flick that\\'s ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment . \\nsomewhere , someplace , i recall hearing species 2 described as \" erotic . \" \\ni would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie , because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism . \\nsure , there\\'s a lot of sex and nudity , but it\\'s almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman\\'s abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions . \\nanyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater . \\ni suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly ) . \\nalthough the character she played in the original species is dead , government scientists still have the dna , and , out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse , they decide to create another clone . \\nthis creature , dubbed \" eve \" by its creator , dr . laura baker ( played by marg helgenberger , reprising her role ) , is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile . \\nmeanwhile , man has finally set foot on mars . \\na team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has traveled to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring something with them . \\nross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he\\'s soon mating like crazy , collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex session . \\nhis intention is obviously world domination . \\nstanding in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film , preston lennox ( michael madsen ) , and one of patrick\\'s fellow astronauts , dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) . \\nbut when patrick learns about eve , a female of his kind , there\\'s no damping his ardor . \\ni\\'m not sure what the budget for species 2 was , but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects ) . \\nmichael madsen and marg helgenberger , both back for a second round , are clearly on hand to do as little as they can , grab the money , and run . \\nditto for james cromwell , who plays patrick\\'s father -- \" underused \" is too kind a word to describe his involvement ( \" invisible \" would be more like it ) . \\ngeorge dzundza gets to do a little scenery- chewing as an angry-but-inept general . \\nmeanwhile , justin lazard\\'s performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge\\'s limited abilities look good by comparison . \\nthe only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick . \\ncomplete with cheesy special effects , bare breasts around every narrative corner , and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter , species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics . \\ndirector peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume , has added another forgettable title , but at least he appears to have had fun doing it , which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness . \\ndo i recommend the movie ? \\nabsolutely not , but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn\\'t try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad movies do . \\nhere\\'s hoping there\\'s no species 3 . \\n',\n",
       " b\"lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient . \\ngreat acting , music and cinematography were nice , but too many dull sub-plots and characters made the film hard to follow . \\nralph fiennes ( strange days , schindler's list ) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy , a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy . \\nthe story revolves around his past , in flashback form , making it even more confusing . \\nanyway , he is taken in by hana ( juliette binoche , the horseman on the roof ) , a boring war-torn nurse . \\nshe was never really made into anything , until she met an indian towards the end , developing yet another sub-plot . \\ncount almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger ( willem dafoe , basquiat ) . \\nhis love ( kirstin scott thomas , mission impossible ) was severely injured in a plane crash , and eventually died in a cave . \\nhe returned to find her dead and was heart-broken . \\nso he flew her dead body somewhere , but was shot down from the ground . \\ndon't get the wrong idea , it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting , but good is the last thing this film is . \\nmaybe if it were an hour less , it may have been tolerable , but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle . \\nthe only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography . \\nother than these , the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film . \\n , \\n\",\n",
       " b' \" love is the devil \" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist\\'s psyche rather than the artist\\'s lifeline . \\nwatching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter . \\neverything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film\\'s subject , looked at it personally . \\nbut while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what\\'s going on . \\nexactly what was i looking at ? \\nwatching this film , i wasn\\'t sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous . \\ndirected ( and written ) by john maybury , \" love is the devil \" is stylish masterpiece for the senses . \\neverything looks originally bizarre and perplexing . \\nthe camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close . \\nthe editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon\\'s world and psyche . \\nas such , there is no real story . \\ni\\'ve not heard much about francis bacon that i didn\\'t read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like . \\nhe was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty . \\nas played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he\\'s like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero . \\nhe lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him . \\nit\\'s as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( \" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , \" he says one night at the bar he frequents ) . \\n \" love is the devil \" chronicles the latter part of his life . \\nbacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor . \\nhe walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) . \\nbacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning . \\ngeorge agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason . \\nthe film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another . \\nwhile creating bacon\\'s world of friends ( like \" high art , \" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant . \\nbacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn\\'t understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings . \\nwhile watching this , that\\'s basically all i thought was there . \\nthe film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about . \\nonce the film is over , it\\'s easier to piece it together . \\ni kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was . \\nsomeone doesn\\'t merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in . \\nthinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother . \\ni thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer\\'s head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein\\'s \" battleship potemkin \" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain . \\nhe drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn\\'t for george . \\ni guess that explains the title . \\na bit . \\nthat\\'s great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning . \\ni wish it hadn\\'t reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) . \\nor maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man\\'s twisted pysche . \\nit\\'s almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man\\'s uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience\\'s throat . \\nthat way you don\\'t reduce your film to something it\\'s just not . \\ni can\\'t say i totally enjoyed \" love is the devil , \" though . \\ndespite all of the things i respect about this movie , it\\'s still rather uncomfortable to sit through . \\neven at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour . \\nthough hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man\\'s truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it . \\nas such , i respect the way the film looks . \\nit\\'s beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with \" what dreams may come \" and \" dark city , \" it\\'s the year\\'s most visually stunning film . \\nin fact , if a better script had been forged , i\\'d almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever . \\nand with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs . \\ni just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance . \\nthen i would have had something to hold me over even now . \\n',\n",
       " b'it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable . \\nthe academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed . \\nit also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner . \\nwhat i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 . \\nwhat drags braveheart down is its screenplay . \\nit abounds with high production values : john toll\\'s award-winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick\\'s 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names . \\nbut this does not save a misguided script . \\nthe film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer\\'s only response to his \" heroism \" is intellectual : william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him . \\nbut wallace\\'s actions paint a different story . \\nhe speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance . \\nthough one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king . \\nwallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance . \\nafter kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england . \\nthis is evident of a \" spartacus complex \" , and this example applies both historically and cinematically . \\nthe historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay . \\nit is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film . \\nhorner\\'s score tries to make emotional connection , but the performances and the script do not help . \\ngibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him . \\nthis drags down any emotional connection to the film\\'s plot , and turns three hours into a total waste of time . \\n',\n",

       " b'john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles . \\nso effortlessly that people tend to forget he\\'s there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor\\'s face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors ) . \\nexample : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn\\'t be more divergent--- i\\'ll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! \\nwas a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn\\'t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation . \\ni muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity . \\nshe responded with her usual query , \" whose in that one ? \" \\nthis is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see . \\nif the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace . \\nanyway , when i answered \" john cusack \" , she replied with a rather stunned \" who ? \" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to . \\nnow i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it\\'s understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces . \\ni showed her a picture of cusack\\'s mug in the paper hoping for an \" oh - him , yes he\\'s quite good \" instead i got a \" no - i don\\'t know him \" . \\nat this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack\\'s relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car . \\ncu-sack . cu-sack - no , not quite as cool . \\ni\\'m sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as \" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) \" . \\nhe\\'s not a brand name , and his movies usually aren\\'t big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he\\'s kind of a genius . \\nwith his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90\\'s . \\nfrom the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon . \\ndespite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he\\'s a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen . \\nand he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin\\'s and val kilmer\\'s seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller ) . \\nhigh fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it\\'s a hit . \\nit was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank . \\nit\\'s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me . \\nhigh fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his \" top 5 break ups list \" . \\nthis is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller\\'s day off . \\nat first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack\\'s witty delivery . \\nhe\\'s the kind of guy we don\\'t mind talking directly to us . \\ngradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it\\'s all very existential ) . \\nthough that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films . \\nthe best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis\\' hair ?

       " b' \" say , any of you know how to madison ? \" \\n--- brad \" asshole \" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show . \\nthe story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend . \\nin the early 70\\'s , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o\\'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design . \\nthe result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england . \\nthe play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974 . \\nthe film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975 . . . \\nand immediately tanked at the box office . \\nwhether it was because fox wasn\\'t quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn\\'t quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop . \\nit seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters . \\na year later , something entirely strange and magical happened . \\nprints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film . \\nthis new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time . \\nword quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show\\'s life as the ultimate cult film was born . \\nfor the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton . \\nbrad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed . \\nthey plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr . everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home . \\nremembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance . \\nthe castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr . frank-n-furter ( tim curry ) . \\nfrank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood ) . \\nas rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter\\'s mad schemes . \\nlittle do any of them know that the doctor\\'s handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o\\'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth . \\ngoing back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has . \\nif i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don\\'t think i would have known what to make of it either . \\nfor all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film . \\nby the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o\\'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on . \\nwhen i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity . \\nit goes without saying that the \" time warp \" is the most popular song in the film . \\neven people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song . \\nwhat those who haven\\'t seen the movie don\\'t know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment . \\nmy personal favorite is \" over at the frankenstein place \" , but \" dammit janet \" is also maddeningly catchy . \\ntim curry\\'s vocals on the rocking tune \" sweet transvestite \" need to be heard to be believed . \\nthe finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick . . . \\nfrightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( \" rose tint my world \" , \" don\\'t dream it \" , \" wild and untamed thing \" , and \" i\\'m going home \" ) , all of which are immensely singable . \\nthe film\\'s true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though . \\ndespite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn\\'t have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show . \\nwatching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don\\'t mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place ) . \\nnote : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton . \\nthe two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own . \\no\\'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original . \\n25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world . \\nas a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary ) . \\nif you are one of those people who can\\'t get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites . \\nin an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it\\'ll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all . \\nthe film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) . \\nthe film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called \" superheroes \" . \\nfor ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen . \\noriginally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number ) . \\nmost reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced . \\nthe film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o\\'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews ) . \\nthe two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) . \\nfox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments . \\nthe first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is . \\nthe second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show . \\nmost of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter . \\nthe final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote . \\nwhen selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world . \\nonce the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off . \\nthe first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player . \\nthere is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don\\'t know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don\\'t know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff\\'s story lab . \\nlinks to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc . \\nthe second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras . \\nformer lite-rock video channel turned music historians vh-1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the \" behind the music : rocky horror \" special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop-up video for the meat loaf-sung \" hot patootie \" . \\nthe \" behind the music \" segments are all very interesting , especially richard o\\'brien\\'s jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot . \\nthere are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o\\'brien , and meat loaf interviews . \\nas far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here . \\none of which is just the \" superheroes \" number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called \" once in a while \" . \\na series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick\\'s pants ) . \\nfor the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here . \\nrounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show , two theatrical trailers ( proclaiming that the film is \" a different sort of jaws \" ) , a still gallery , and two sing-a-longs ( for \" toucha toucha touch me \" and \" sweet transvestite \" ) . \\nfox\\'s special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives ( \" you\\'re lucky . . . \\ni\\'m lucky . . . \\nhe\\'s lucky . . . \\nwe\\'re all lucky ! \" ) . \\nit\\'s not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u . s . , but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format . \\nas with their excellent dvds of the abyss , fight club , independence day , and the sound of music , fox shows that they have most

       " b\"the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways . \\nin this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others . \\nthis movie closely resembles a james bond flick . \\nit has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal . \\nkilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations . \\nthe movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests . \\nas a young boy , kilmer's character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork . \\nthat is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name , that of a catholic saint . \\nhe refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be . \\nthis leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life . \\nkilmer's first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija . \\nduring a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles . \\nonce his mission is completed and he is safely home , the fee is paid . \\nwhen he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million , he decides to carry out only one more mission , then retire . \\ndr . emma russell , portrayed by elisabeth shue , has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion . \\nthis new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia , where millions are without heat and are freezing to death . \\nthe only problem is , tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people . \\nthis presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal . \\ntretiak hires him to steal the equations , small pieces of paper , from shue . \\none of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions . \\nthey are very convincing , not only to the characters in the movie , but to us . \\nkilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue's character into getting to know him even more , which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula . \\nwhen the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer's character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer's alter-ego , a traveling artist . \\nyet , he must reach his goal of $50 million , which requires him to steal the energy formula , putting his feelings aside . \\nshue's character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces ( the names of the catholic saints ) together , something no one else is able to do . \\nwhen she finds him , they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak . \\nthe saint is very action-packed , with few slow points . \\nthe sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments . \\nalong the course of the movie , there are even a few , although brief moments of comedy . \\nthese moments are almost always thanks to kilmer's extraneous , very convincing disguises and personalities . \\nall in all , a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non-stop action . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night . \\ni went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success : personal growth and insightful humor about life . \\ni came away somewhat disappointed in this regard , getting some of the latter and not much of the former . \\nthe basic plot revolves around billy crystal , who plays mitch robbins , turning forty . \\nhe's now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original . \\nhe's given a job at the radio station to his best friend , played by daniel stern , out of sympathy while stern's character works through his divorce . \\nhis loser younger brother ( john lovitz ) comes to mitch's house to bum a money and place to live , all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday . \\nduring the celebration , mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curly's ( the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance ) old hat . \\nafter a business trip to las vegas , crystal , stern , and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure . \\non the way , they run into curly's twin brother , duke , played by ( you know who ) jack palance . \\nfirst of all , the cinematography was beautifully done , especially the outdoor scenes in the desert . \\nthe scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself . \\nthere is some character development during the film . \\nthe actors remain true to their characters and play them well , without overplaying the jokes . \\nthe movie is a good basic adventure , with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict . \\nthe movie is paced well , but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end . \\nhumor-wise , the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film . \\nthere are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake , but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel ( surprise , surprise for a sequel , right ? ) . \\nhowever , the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film's manipulation of the audience . \\nthe film tries to pull your heart-strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other , like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend's butt . \\nthis is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original . \\nthere were also some parts which appeared unrealistic , like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn't worry more about water while tromping around the desert . \\nsome strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here . \\nsince the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich ( unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original ) , i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey . \\noverall , i'd say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some story-line deficiencies making it less worthy than the original . \\nit may be worth the full price of admission , but a matinee would be a better bargain . \\n\",\n",

\\nthe editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times . \\nthe real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego . \\nworking from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times . \\nits strict adherence to clich ? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 ) . \\nthere simply isn't an original scene in this film . \\nthe dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking . \\nthis is director mandoki's first film since when a man loves a woman ( 1994 ) , the solid meg ryan/andy garcia romance . \\nhe's simply going through the motions with this . \\nmessage in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come ( 1998 ) as one of the most misguided romances of the decade . \\n\",\n",

was released , \" at first sight \" is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama . \\nthe film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed-out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country . \\nat the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind . \\namy doesn\\'t really care if he has a handicap or not , and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love . \\nonce she has returned to new york , amy begins to research on virgil\\'s certain type of retinal blindness , which he has had since three years of age , and out of a stroke of luck , comes into contact with a doctor ( bruce davison ) who believes he can repair virgil\\'s sight , even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history . \\nat first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis ) . \\nultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects . \\nhe moves into amy\\'s apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil\\'s maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship . \\non the basis of the overall story , \" at first sight \" is indeed a film that has been done many times before , and owes a great deal to its predecessor , \" awakenings . \" \\nwhat will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance . \\nhowever , what helps \" at first sight \" rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy . \\nusually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer \" you\\'ve got mail \" immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . \\nthe film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil . \\nthe massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual \" love scenes , \" and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two . \\nthese joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy\\'s eventful life in the \" big city . \" \\nthe other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board . \\nval kilmer , usually cast in the \" macho \" type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears . \\nit was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off . \\nmira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995\\'s hilarious woody allen comedy , \" mighty aphrodite , \" for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here . \\nalthough she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997\\'s \" mimic , \" 1998\\'s \" the replacement killers \" ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with \" at first sight \" that she finally has another juicy role to play . \\nin a truthful climactic scene set in amy\\'s apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces . \\nkelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the \" bad , \" one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother . \\nfinally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist . \\nthe one misstep of \" at first sight \" is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil . \\nvery little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . \\nperhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder . \\nin \" awakenings , \" the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed . \\nbecause of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film\\'s few problems can be swept over to the side . \\nthe adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) . \\nsince january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , \" at first sight \" comes as a refreshing and

       " b'i feel no hesitation in saying that \" there\\'s something about mary \" is the best film that i will see all year . \\nfrom the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998 . \\nit is that good of a film . \\nwhen gene siskel said this about \" fargo \" only a few months into \\'96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous . \\nhow could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ? \\nbut after seeing the farrelly\\'s hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about . \\nonce in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer . \\nand you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special . \\nnow for the shocker ; \" mary \" is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( \" pink flamingos \" obviously notwithstanding ) . \\nthe movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for ) . \\nforget \" blazing saddles \" , \" animal house \" and even the former king of gross-out comedy , \" monty python\\'s meaning of life \" ; they were all only preludes to the farrelly\\'s assault on the senses . \\nin fact , this may even be the funniest film i\\'ve ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is \" monty python and the holy grail \" ) , and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade . \\nbut as funny as it is , something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of \" mary \" ; it has a huge heart . \\nyou see , the farrelly\\'s are truly gifted filmmakers . \\nthey don\\'t just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around ) . \\nthey also , very wisely , add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses . \\nit\\'s funny , though . \\nif you just look at an outline of the story , it seems kind of contrived and predictable . \\nbut believe me , it is anything but . \\nben stiller plays ted , a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe , mary ( cameron diaz ) . \\nafter he sticks up for her retarded brother , warren ( w . \\nearly brown - the cameraman , believe it or not , from \" scream \" ) , his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom . \\nin one of the film\\'s funniest scenes , something goes wrong ( i won\\'t ruin it for those who know nothing about the film ) and ted is unable to face mary ever again . \\njump to the present . \\nafter years of self-loathing , ted finally hires private detective pat healy ( a suitably slimy matt dillon ) to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school . \\nhealy finds that mary is still a full-blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself . \\nadmittingly , the basic story line leaves a little to be desired . \\nafter all , with a not-really-all-that-funny premise , how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours ? \\nsomehow , the farrelly\\'s pull it off . \\nthe performances here are also right on target . \\nas ted , stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating , as he would normally be , but very lovable . \\nand cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons , but the actor who really grabs your attention is w . earl brown as mary\\'s brother . \\nno other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here . \\ni know he won\\'t be nominated , but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february . \\nas good as the actors are , though , it\\'s the directors\\' movie all the way . \\ni guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year , you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg\\'s wwii epic \" saving private ryan \" . \\nand yes , that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting . \\nbut which is harder ; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can\\'t breath for minutes at a time ? \\ni\\'ll let you decide that one for yourself , but this critic is sticking to his guns . \\nthere is just something about \" mary \" . \\n',\n",
       " b'the story of us , a rob reiner film , is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film , as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films . \\nwell , 1999 has two of them , the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family , american beauty . \\nthe story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry . \\nthe story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , \" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ? \" \\nthe film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are \" him \" and \" her \" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are \" us \" ( during the good times ) . \\nthe story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day . \\nben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don\\'t want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don\\'t , love each other anymore . \\nben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage . \\nkatie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn\\'t mind doing things differently than they were planned . \\nthe story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks . \\nas the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage . \\nthis method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart . \\nthrough the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character\\'s eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters . \\nthe screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson\\'s films , stepmom . \\nthe script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must . \\nif it wasn\\'t for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year\\'s best picture . \\nbruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer\\'s the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script . \\nalthough i wouldn\\'t pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film\\'s most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season . \\nwhere to start about michelle pfeiffer ? \\npfeiffer\\'s performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism . \\npfeiffer\\'s performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart\\'s of any viewer that has watched this moving film . \\nthe story of us is one of 1999\\'s most real , yet funny films , as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked . \\nsuperb acting , direction , writing , story , and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film , which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman , make the story of us a touching , unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country- and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall . \\nthe film\\'s major high points are the fights between ben and katie , as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed , and although they also say things like \" it\\'s over , \" or \" i hate you , \" you can tell the two still share a deep connection , and that inside , somewhere , they are still an \" us . \" \\nthe bottom line : a wonderful , enchanting , and heartbreaking film . \\none of the most realistic , heartbreaking films in recent years . \\n',\n",

       " b'i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in-depth articles about some incident . \\nthey will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail . \\nit becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of . \\nfrequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know . \\noften i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject . \\nfilm is a different medium . \\nit is a visual medium . \\nthat slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize . \\ni frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space . \\nthe magazine article and the film script are two very different media . \\nthe insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article \" the man who knew too much \" by marie brenner . \\nit is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film . \\nit really verges on being tedious at least at times . \\nfor years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects . \\nbut they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it . \\nthe business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco . \\nthe tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking . \\nthe resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs . \\nwho were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ? \\nthat is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider . \\nthis all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well . \\nand in the end , he failed . \\nto make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short . \\nthe film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist . \\nwe get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand . \\nthey go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) . \\nthere the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it . \\nthis seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world . \\nterrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power . \\nincongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home . \\nwe discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly . \\nhe had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family . \\nrather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income . \\nmeanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand . \\nthey offer wigand $12 , 000 just to interpret the data . \\nwigand\\'s severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms . \\nhe is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman . \\nin spite of the secrecy , wigand\\'s former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role . \\nand so the game begins . \\nwigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer . \\nmeanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family . \\nthe film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants . \\nwigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out . \\nhe and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight . \\nal pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider . \\nthe story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail . \\nthe film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience . \\nthe musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory . \\nit puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling . \\nalso disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace . \\nplummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well-known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly . \\nthis film might have been a really engaging experience under another director\\'s control . \\nmichael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style . \\ni rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n",

\\ni haven\\'t the foggiest . \\ni doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply . \\nwith mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects . \\nit\\'s possible that these \" spies \" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored . \\nthe scenes i\\'ve described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character . \\ngod forbid . \\nwoo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals . \\nstill in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish . \\ncruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) . \\nbetween the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact . \\nthe scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us . \\nsure it\\'s all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product . \\nthandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that\\'s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \\\\ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight . \\nthey flirt and exchange obvious double entendres . \\nnewton bats her eyes flirtatiously . \\ncruise grins a little too slyly . \\nthe cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film . \\nhere cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 . \\nhe\\'s cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90\\'s ) . \\nsadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise\\'s initial \" i\\'m the man ! \" \\ncharm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug . \\nmi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won\\'t stop . \\nthe whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could\\'ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the \" symbolic \" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) . \\nwe\\'ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand . \\nit isn\\'t done any differently here . \\nthe action is pure hard target \\\\ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind . \\nhe\\'s cool for sure but he\\'s made to be as empty as the movie . \\nthe actor isn\\'t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one . \\nwhen he\\'s not beaming away , he\\'s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo\\'s editing seriously undermines the effort . \\nhe fetishizes cruise\\'s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof . \\ni half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he\\'s really austin powers . \\nin a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death . \\nthe gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) . \\nthe lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles . \\nthough instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a \" so you thought i was dead . . . \" . \\nnot to worry , cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat . \\nwhat a hero ! \\nyou may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2\\'s plot . \\nmy reasoning is simple : i\\'m not sure of any good it would do . \\nthe film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next \" special \" effect . \\ni wasn\\'t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video . \\nnobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they\\'ll surely regret it . \\nas summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing . \\nin mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma\\'s ( that film\\'s director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo\\'s non-stop masturbatory pandemonium . \\nit\\'s irrelevant in every sense , as is character . \\nall that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors . \\n',\n",

       " b'since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . \\nnow , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . \\nthis realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993\\'s schindler\\'s list shows . \\nmost of today\\'s mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . \\nthat\\'s why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol\\' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . \\nthe movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950\\'s company town of coalwood , west virginia . \\nit\\'s a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . \\nthe mine , which is run by homer\\'s father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however . \\nafter watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , \" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . \" \\ndrafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets . \\nwith the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things . \\noctober sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . \\njohnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he\\'s doing here . \\nhe molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . \\nhe does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film\\'s charm . \\nhis finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer\\'s mother and father . \\nthe cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . \\nlaura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need . \\nher role is instantly likeable . \\nchris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer\\'s father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . \\nhe\\'s definitely a driving force in homer\\'s life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . \\nthe script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys\\' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . \\nthere are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . \\nit highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . \\noctober sky should be a success with audiences . \\nalthough it doesn\\'t have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she\\'s all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . \\nit\\'s a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see . \\n',\n",

       " b'the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of \" leila , \" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features . \\nalthough unfamiliar with mehrjui\\'s previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers . \\nset in modern-day iran , \" leila \" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) . \\nas leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn\\'t quite as sweet . \\nearlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child . \\nwhen all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn\\'t care at all about having children . \\nnonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) . \\nbluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with . \\nleila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens\\' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn\\'t give her full blessing . \\nthere are no easy answers to be found within \" leila , \" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character\\'s unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration . \\nalmost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law\\'s requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman . \\nmaybe because \" leila \" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence . \\nleila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances . \\none of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply . \\nit is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . \\nalthough seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . \\nditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . \\nthese \" small \" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . \\nleft there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . \\nrefusing to stay over at her parent\\'s house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . \\ndespite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . \\nsure , the whole second marriage was his mother\\'s idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn\\'t he ? \\nin the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . \\nunlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . \\nevery bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . \\nfor all of its strong aspects , \" leila \" isn\\'t a perfect film . \\non a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . \\nand concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . \\nmehrjui\\'s decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . \\ndespite these minor missteps , \" leila \" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york\\'s cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . \\nthe thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila\\'s self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return . \\nit\\'s difficult to not consider how leila\\'s culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through . \\n',\n",
       " b\"underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today . \\n1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year . \\nwe always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them . \\nthis year 'double jeopardy' is one of those films . \\ncritics are calling it predictable and worthless , audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment . \\nbut as i viewed 'double jeopardy' i found that it was a great movie , it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart , along with heart-pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie . \\nthe always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons , a woman with a seemingly normal life : a great loving husband , a beautiful son and a great friend . \\nher husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted . \\nafter a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat , her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck . \\nof course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her . \\nhowever she isn't immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money . \\nshe pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years . \\nwhile making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad , which makes libby's heart stop right there . \\nshe realizes she must get out and prove that he isn't dead , one of her cell-mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again . \\nwhich means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it . \\nafter she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones . \\nhe is a man who has had his share of bad things . \\nwhile out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband , leading up to some jaw-dropping twists that are both predictable and not . \\nwhatever happens the film was excellent to me . \\ni found the writing well-written as well as the acting was great . \\nashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie . \\neven if you know what is going to happen in the end , you don't know how . \\nthis is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen , except you don't know how they are going to make it happen . \\nit could be one way or another , it could be this way or that way . \\nthe movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made . \\nit gets most of it's power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances . \\nthe characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby's pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years . \\neven though a lot of critics didn't like the film , i loved it . \\nthe director took his time making the movie , and put a lot of shadowing in the movie . \\ni found it not to be boring at all and it's only flaw comes from some predictability . \\nit moved at a fast pace , has suspense , humor , heart and great acting . \\nit earns it's right to be a great movie and to me that's what it was . \\n\",\n",
       " b' \" the celebration \" is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant . \\nyou know , where you sit down to watch it , and no matter what you\\'ve heard about it before , you just can\\'t help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs . \\ni prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like . \\ni don\\'t really feel there are to be any real \" rules \" for cinema ; a film can do anything , as long as it makes it work . \\nbut i do ask that all films have one thing in common : they create experiences . \\nwhen i watch a film , no matter what kind of film it is , i want to be able to take certain memories along with me . \\n \" the celebration \" is great because it\\'s chock full of those . \\nit creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life . \\nand then it makes things just a tad bit farscial , just to make sure you\\'re paying attention , which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored , then you\\'re of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up . \\nthe story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him . \\nall his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) . \\nthe eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father\\'s home . \\nhis brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable . \\nwe then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she\\'s going to . \\nonce they\\'re all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film\\'s punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age . \\nbut since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it\\'s all terribly interesting to watch . \\ntwists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends . \\nthe most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion . \\nas a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose \" the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability \" so that they may \" purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot . \" \\ni have not seen \" breaking the waves , \" the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but \" the celebration \" works exquisitely in this department . \\nit feels like reality , like you\\'re actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video . \\nas a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to . \\nwe see key moments in people\\'s lives that they wouldn\\'t dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film . \\nthe key , though , to this film , and the reason it\\'s not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth . \\nthroughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water . \\nof course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn\\'t have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them . \\nand yes , it\\'s thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier . \\nbut then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he\\'s done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface . \\nthe final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex . \\neveryone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them . \\nthe

       " b\"in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french-canadian co-production by max fischer . \\nthe movie is set in paris where its hero , struggling american author david mirkine ( judd nelson , at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity ) suffers a terrible writers bloc . \\nhe manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle ( laurence treill ) . \\nunfortunately , she hangs out in jet set circles , which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous . \\nher connection with powerful david caravan ( pierce brosnan ) would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events . \\nalthough few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller , drama would probably be more appropriate genre label . \\npacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers , and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments . \\nlow budget also becomes painfully visible , and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film . \\nunfortunately , this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes , so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed . \\ninstead , they would have to settle with pointless , slow scenes involving nelson , brosnan and laurence treill's attempts of serious acting . \\nall of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone's precious time . \\n\",\n",

       " b'i know that \" funnest \" isn\\'t a word . \\n \" fun \" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . \\nbut that\\'s the word that came to me right after viewing \" chicken run . \" \\nno wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like \" that was the funnest movie i\\'ve ever seen ! \" \\nso to hell with webster\\'s -- \" chicken run \" is one of the funnest movies i\\'ve seen in a while . \\ni can\\'t remember the last time i\\'ve seen anything funner . \\nthe chickens at tweedy\\'s farm are up to something . \\nliving in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . \\none night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . \\nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm\\'s egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . \\nshe orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , \" chickens go in ; pies come out . \" \\nwhat sort of pies ? \\nchicken pies , of course . \\nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \\nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \\npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park\\'s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \\n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \\nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \\nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \\nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \\nthing is , the film doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \\npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \\npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \\nbut they\\'re * chickens * , so it\\'s funny to us . \\nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park\\'s films ) succeed is the animators\\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\\'re cribbing . \\nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \\nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \\nthere\\'s even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\\'s nationality and film history . \\nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \\nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \\nconsider this : since july of last year , i\\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \\nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \\nwhy ? \\nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they\\'re parodying that \\'blair witch\\' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \\nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \\nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn\\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \\nif you\\'ve never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \\neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \\npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\\'s understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \\nenjoyment of this movie doesn\\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\\'ve got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \\nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \\nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \\nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \\nthe characters\\' inevitable romance doesn\\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \\npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\\'t any help . \\njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \\nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \\none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \\nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \\nthe animation is first-rate . \\nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \\nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \\nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug\\'s life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \\ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\\'ll catch all the details . \\nanyway , the movie\\'s just a boatload of fun . \\nfunnest damn movie i\\'ve seen all year . \\n',\n",

       " b'most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts . \\nmy family , for the most part , hates him and his movies . \\ni think he\\'s very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years . \\nso maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of . \\nunrestrained by physical boundaries , allen\\'s humor comes shining through . \\nthose who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen\\'s intelligent observations of life . \\nthose who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one . \\nin 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they\\'d never seen before . \\ntoy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present . \\nmany critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture . \\nantz , however , has upped the ante considerably . \\ndisney\\'s a bug\\'s life isn\\'t due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal . \\nby beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience\\'s thirst for computer-animated films . \\nbut don\\'t let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared . \\nin the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios . \\nin 1997 , it was the volcano duel . \\nin my opinion , dante\\'s peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality . \\nvolcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations . \\nin 1998 , there are twice as many competing films . \\nfirst was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it\\'s cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact . \\nbut now , it\\'s even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) . \\nwho will prevail ? \\ntime will tell , but i\\'m sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear . \\nthis may sound like i didn\\'t like antz ; on the contrary , i\\'d put it up there with toy story . \\nbut due to it\\'s pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn\\'t appear in disney\\'s version . \\nsome of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film . \\nsexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks\\' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd . \\nthe humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . \\nthis is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents . \\nantz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen\\'s shtick and franz kafka\\'s metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug . \\nz ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker . \\n \" when you\\'re the middle child in a family of five million . . . \" he comments about his neglected childhood . \\none night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life . \\nin walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown . \\nbala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader . \\nafter discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there\\'s a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony . \\nin order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants . \\nbut to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her . \\nhe and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed . \\nthe queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony . \\nmeanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him . \\nso z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites . \\nthe battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . \\nhowever , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence . \\nthe second half of the film revolves around z\\'s kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia . \\nthere , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants . \\nthe adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass . \\nlooming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i\\'m just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) . \\nthe ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground . \\nvisually , it\\'s an exciting rush of adrenaline . \\nbut don\\'t be fooled . . . \\nlittle kids shouldn\\'t see this , as they may just try and copy it . \\nafter seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . \\nhopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . \\nas an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . \\nvisually , it\\'s as stunning as what dreams may come . \\nthe best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren\\'t limited by gravity . \\nthey can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . \\none great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . \\nthe animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . \\nhowever , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy\\'s shoe . \\nit\\'s truly a great example of film making at its finest . \\nwith computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants\\' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . \\nthe best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . \\nat one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . . \\ndo they ? ) . \\nbarbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body . \\nyoung kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . \\ndisney\\'s a bug\\'s life looks good , but i don\\'t know if they will be able to best dreamworks\\' newest animated feature in terms of animation . \\nif not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) . \\nvocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story . \\nin fact , it far exceeds that one . \\nwoody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he\\'s done in the past few years . \\nwithout a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . \\nin fact , i\\'m pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . \\nsharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . \\nsylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . \\nafter a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . \\ngene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . \\nchristopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . \\nanne bancroft has a minimal role , but she\\'s effective nonetheless . \\ndanny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . \\ndan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . \\njennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won\\'t recognize her voice either . \\nmany people will recognize grant shaud\\'s voice as the foreman . \\nhe played miles on the tv show murphy brown . \\nthis is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it\\'s grosses . \\nof course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also . \\ndirectors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . \\nbut both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . \\ntense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . \\nthe screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . \\nkids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . \\nmost of it will go over young children\\'s heads . \\ndoes that mean you shouldn\\'t take kids to see it ? \\nnot at all . \\nthey will have a lot of fun watching this one . \\nwhat is great is the themes that are given to us . \\npart social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community . \\nthankfully , it\\'s not subtle in either aspects . \\nantz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action . \\nsometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home . \\nthe battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death . \\nand the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight . \\nbut other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it\\'s a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters . \\ni doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it\\'s still advisable to leave really young children at home . \\nhave i confused you enough ?

       " b\"jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation . \\non the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice . \\non the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events . \\nthis choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow . \\nindeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled . \\n_beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war . \\nfor newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil . \\noprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end . \\nwhat she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished . \\n_beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin . \\nthe film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse . \\ninvisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards . \\nsethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves . \\ndemme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects . \\nall of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real . \\nwhen paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror . \\ninstead , he asks who the ghost is . \\nas in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created . \\nsethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears . \\nin fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay . \\nthe story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) , a young black-clad woman who appears on sethe's front lawn , leaned christ-like against a tree stump . \\nsethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health . \\nthey know not who she is , but that doesn't matter . \\nonly paul d is suspicious of the stranger . \\nlittle does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes , and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years . \\nwinfrey is arguably beloved's greatest asset . \\nshe inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show . \\nlisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe , whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later . \\ndanny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d , as is kimberly elise as denver , sethe's wanderlusting daughter . \\nas sethe's sage-like mother-in-law old baby suggs , beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears . \\nthe film's least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself . \\nthandie newton plays the glassy-eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first , but which becomes off-putting and unintentionally laughable by the end . \\ndeparting from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison's novel . \\ntotemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films , but the few he uses here work to the film's benefit . \\n_beloved_'s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs' gatherings in a forest clearing , where the bright yellow-greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs' words do . \\nfor the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality . \\nthis , combined with morrison's equally frugal method of storytelling , may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch , even to those familiar with the book . \\nthough the film compliments the book extraordinarily well , it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film . \\nnothing is spoon-fed to the viewer . \\nmorrison's novel is just as enigmatic , but unlike a movie , a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb . \\nthe movie begins like _poltergeist_ , and ends like _the color purple_ , with shades of _the scarlet letter_ and _little women_ somewhere in the middle . \\ntaken as a whole , beloved is a disquieting , one-of-a-kind experience , one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance . \\n\",\n",

       " b'i have to say it . \\ntim burton\\'s retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys . \\nok , that\\'s off my chest . \\nno more monkey puns , i promise . \\nseriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip-roarin\\' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny ( dare i say , monkey ) business . \\ni know , i know , i promised . \\nand for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton\\'s version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie . \\nmark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future . \\nhe crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery . \\ndespite being darker than the original , burton\\'s film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious . \\nsome of the movie\\'s flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed . \\nthen there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter . \\nthe seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : \" one thing you don\\'t want in your house is a human teen-ager , \" he says . \\nyou don\\'t have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement . \\ntouches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton\\'s brand . \\nlines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian\\'s foot to try righting himself are : \" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human . \" \\nanyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue . \\nanother of burton\\'s in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth\\'s gen . thade . \\nthe young chimp goes to visit his dying father . \\nboth have one thing in common , a hatred of humans . \\nwith his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : \" damn them , damn them all to hell , \" he says before expiring . \\nthat is the famous line heston\\'s taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet\\'s terrible secret . \\nthe performances throughout are top-notch . \\nwahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home . \\nhe is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet . \\nthis hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable . \\nroth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity . \\nhe leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet . \\nit is a masterful turn . \\nhelena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals . \\nhers is a smart , compassionate characterization . \\nmichael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken . \\na fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures . \\nas the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , \" can\\'t we all just get along , \" echoing the words of rodney king . \\nmuch of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton\\'s technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup . \\nburton\\'s musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow . \\nthe movie\\'s only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original . \\nhe comes close , but falls short . \\notherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs . \\nthis is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype . \\n',\n",

s : we-lei becomes absorbed in his career , indulges in an affair with a co-worker ; jia-li feels restless and trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems wise . \\nthe film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured . \\nit unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia-li meets her brother\\'s old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college . \\nboth women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness . \\ntheir circumstances ( and those of jia-li\\'s brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc . --but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate . \\nit is not that jia-li married the wrong man ; she didn\\'t . \\nthe problem is that she needed to marry at all--and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy . \\nfor a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins . \\nthe film\\'s sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan . \\nseen now , it does not seem provocative . \\nindeed , it\\'s hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull . \\nand what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined . \\nnor does he bring anything new--other than the locale--to the material . \\nthere are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for--in a young couple\\'s first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband\\'s mistress--but they are brief . \\ntoo often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes--grocery shopping , flower-arranging--in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted . \\nperhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating . \\nbut jia-li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties . \\nat two hours and forty-five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long-winded . \\nconsider the defining moment for jia-li , the titular day on the beach . \\nthe thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation . \\neven so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point . \\nneedless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout . \\nthe look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative . \\nit was the first feature shot by christopher doyle--at least , it\\'s his name in the credits--who is now rightly regarded as one of the world\\'s leading cinematographers . \\nin the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar-wai , he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image . \\nyou would never know it from watching that day , which , due either to doyle\\'s inexperience or yang\\'s humdrum direction , is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible . \\nin scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak . \\n',\n",

\\nwhere is the u . n . ? \\nthe film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? \\nthis film ( in a way akin to films such as \" a few good men \" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism . \\nthese accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair . \\nwhat director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking . \\none of the earliest apparent problems with \\'rules of engagement\\' is its lack of credibility . \\nthe entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed . \\na lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality . \\nthat is precisely why it\\'s not offensive . \\nit is completely unobjective . \\nmany stories are started and never finished . \\nmany questions are asked , but never answered . \\na lot of parallels are referring to nothing . \\nit seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film . \\nis it about arab mentality ? \\namerica\\'s foreign policies ? \\namerica\\'s role in the world ? \\ncorruption in the higher circles ? \\nit goes on and on . \\nit consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot . \\nit tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one . \\ni think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin\\'s probably most acclaimed film was \" the exorcist \" which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film . \\nin this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film . \\nthough several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage . \\ni believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed . \\nit\\'s obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe . \\nthe characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict . \\neven the actors can not save this film from going under . \\nthough both jackson and jones act admirably , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this , it is not something that these great actors can boast of . \\nthey have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back . \\njackson is gray and jones uninteresting . \\nthe rest of the cast , including ben kingsly , blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks . \\nthe time has come for the verdict . \\non the charges of complete lack of objectivity , i find this film guilty . \\non the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking , i find it guilty . \\nbut on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty , because of it\\'s inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere , not only when concerning the arab population . \\ni must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far , portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad-guys . \\nthis is very sad , since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth . \\nhowever , it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states . \\nand that it\\'s not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east , including yemen are on constant maximum alert . \\n',\n",

       " b'it\\'s an interesting premise . \\nour reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . \\nin truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . \\nwhat we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . \\nour bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet . \\nthe sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along . \\nthe matrix isn\\'t it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one\\'s brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . \\nwhat is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking . \\nkeanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines . \\nthe group\\'s leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is \" the one \" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence . \\n>from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . \\nthis , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . \\nwhat is reality ? \\nwhat is a sham ? \\nthe film turns our very perception of life on its side . \\nmore than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . \\nas viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo . \\nand who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? \\nreeves , whom i\\'ve never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety . \\nhe was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . \\nneo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught . \\nin a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski . \\ni mean , since bill and ted\\'s excellent adventure , what movie could you say really \" utilized \" keanu reeves ? \\nmore interesting than reeves is fishburne , who\\'s morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . \\nvery surprising for a sci-fi movie . \\nfishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect . \\nthis helps to further the aura of his character\\'s proficiency and extensive knowledge . \\nhugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence\\'s anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . \\nunfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character\\'s speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . \\ncarrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus\\'s number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . \\nalthough her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn\\'t in the picture . \\nthere were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . \\nmany methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . \\nof special note is the use of the \" freeze and turn \" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle . \\nthis is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . \\nthe motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . \\nplace each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . \\npretty slick . \\nthe matrix drips with style . \\nfrom the clothing to the music to the action , we\\'re watching an exaggerated version of what we\\'re used to . \\nmuch of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there\\'s a lot of kung fu , there\\'s a lot of gunplay . \\nwhen a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . \\nthere\\'s also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . \\ncombined , it\\'s really like no live-action film i have ever seen . \\nthe film is not without its faults . \\nsome of the scenes and ideas are \" borrowed \" a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . \\nsome of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn\\'t meant to be a joke . \\nhowever , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain . \\n',\n",

       " b\"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . \\ncinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . \\ntechnically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . \\nlawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . \\nthree lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . \\na final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . \\nopinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . \\nin fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . \\nreal life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . \\nspielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . \\ndjimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances . \\n\",\n",

\\nno ? well , how about sharon stone ? \\nthought so ) . \\nif anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven\\'t seen that many films . \\nthere is no suspense here . \\ntrust me , i looked hard to find some . \\ni had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations . \\nfincher aim\\'s for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas . \\nthere are those that might say \" the game \" is not intended to be viewed literally . \\ni would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film . \\nthe film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues . \\nthere is a moment early in the film where van orton , realizing his game has begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who\\'s in on the whole thing . \\nhe is charged by his paranoia . \\nhe is looking at the world through new eyes . \\nit is the last thought-provoking moment in the film . \\nfrom there on , the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us . \\nany significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device . \\nat the outset , we\\'re told each \" game \" is tailored to the individual . \\nultimately , this \" game \" is supposed to work like a crucible , trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire , proving his soul . \\nyet , as douglas endures his personal gauntlet , we\\'re given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is . \\ni wanted to like this film more than i did . \\ni look at it as just anothergreat idea , poorly realized . \\ni can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn\\'t mean we were seeing what was really happening . \\nbryan singer\\'s \" the usual suspects \" for one , a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas . \\nalso , there is the underrated \" jacob\\'s ladder , \" with tim robbins , a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism . \\nhere are two examples of films that don\\'t simply manipulate for manipulations\\' sake . \\nthere are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place . \\none major issue that comes up in \" the game \" is whether or not the whole \" illusion \" is just a highly sophisticated con game . \\nwell , i can tell you right now , after you\\'ve spent your $7 dollars , you may be asking yourself the same thing . \\n',\n",
       " b'for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality , trois is surprisingly tame . \\ndespite it\\'s lurid subject matter and it\\'s passing nod to fatal attraction , it moves along with flat , uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film . \\nfreshly moved to atlanta , jermaine ( dourdan ) and his wife , jasmine ( moore ) , have the trappings of a perfect life . \\nthey have a beautiful house in suburbia . \\njermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm . \\njasmine is his supportive wife , who is finishing up her college degree . \\nin an opening montage via a home video of the pair , we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs . \\nthis is a couple that has it all . \\ninto this eden slithers the lure of lust . \\ndespite his outward appearance , jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person . \\na glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business , oblivious to jasmine\\'s concerns . \\nwe also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage- a-trois , much to jasmine\\'s dismay . \\nas jermaine puts it , \" don\\'t you want to be sexually free ? \" \\njermaine shares his desire with co-worker terrence ( smith ) , who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter . \\nthe woman , jade ( palmer ) is a direct counterpoint to jasmine . \\njade , at one point was a college student , too . \\nunlike jasmine , she found herself pregnant , dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet . \\nto further reinforce their differences , it\\'s revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son . \\ninevitably , through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaine\\'s part , the forbidden act is consummated . \\nthe aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaine\\'s property with the hint that the violence may escalate . \\nby this point , trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama : a fatal attraction without the social significance . \\nthe exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical . \\njermaine comes off as insincere , sexually driven and selfish . \\njasmine is bland and subservient . \\njade comes off a bit sympathetically , but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy . \\nyet another tale of a sexually aggressive \" dog \" of a man who imposes his will upon his accommodating , innocent mate . \\nthe last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve , but by this point , will you even care ? \\nif the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending , perhaps there could have been some freshness to it . \\nas it stands , trois is pretty standard fare . \\n',\n",

       " b'titanic is , without a doubt , the best movie i\\'ve seen all year . \\nand believe me , i\\'m not an easy critic to impress : the english patient was too long , men in black was over-hyped , and several of the \" big summer releases \" were dead in the water . \\nthank god this film got delayed until december . \\nit\\'s my christmas present . \\ntitanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years-gone-by , and it is truly a stunning film . \\nwhile watching this picture you are completely mesmerized , never taking your eyes off the screen , nor checking your watch to see how much longer it\\'s gonna last , despite its 3 hour plus running time . \\nas a friend of mine , who\\'s a true titanic-buff , said \" if someone doesn\\'t like this film , it\\'s because they didn\\'t want to . \" \\ntruer words are hard to come by . \\nof course , it doesn\\'t hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time . \\nif you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc . still care to disagree ? \\nnot only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it . \\nand to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs . \\nit\\'s obvious he truly loves titanic . \\nthe film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the \" heart of the ocean \" , which , according to bill paxton\\'s character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today . \\ntheir search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond . \\nthis picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture . \\nshe is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond . \\nalmost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past . \\nrose\\'s narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn\\'t want to marry . \\nher mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant . \\nthey are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal . \\nmeanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game . \\nthey are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving . \\nfor them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life . \\nfor rose , she is sailing to her doom . \\nthe first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love . \\nit\\'s the classic wrong-side-of-the-tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches . \\nbut as i said above , the love portion isn\\'t sappy and doesn\\'t \" weigh the film down \" , as some critics have said . \\nit\\'s sweet , and it didn\\'t make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories . \\nof course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen . \\nmost of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on . \\nall of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch . \\nof course , things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom . \\nthe sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing . \\nit is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths . \\nthe best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future . \\nthe crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose\\'s story , now are totally aborbed by her . \\nrose goes out onto the ship\\'s ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard . \\nwe then see a dream of rose\\'s , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson . \\nmost people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream . \\nhowever , i think it symbolized more ; i think it meant that rose had died , and is going to a sort of heaven , which would be the happiest part of her life : her and her one true love , jack . \\nif anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this , e-mail me at venom8@hotmail . com . \\n',\n",

       " b\"damn those trailers . \\nhad it not been for the advertising of this film , which reveals far too much about its contents , i would have been glued to `under the sand' . \\nas it is , the film retains some value , thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling , and a more mature francois ozon in the director's chair . \\nmarie ( charlotte rampling ) and her husband jean ( bruno cremer ) lounge on the beach . \\nshe takes a nap while he goes for a swim . \\nwhen marie wakes up , jean is nowhere to be found . \\nshe contacts authorities , but they can't find him either . \\ndid he disappear to start a new life ? \\nwas he killed by accident ? \\ndid he commit suicide ? \\nmarie still asks herself these questions a year later , and in order to move on with her life , she must find some answers . \\nit's a fine premise , and this little movie uses it to the limit . \\nthe film moves at a leisurely pace , a bit slow , but relaxing . \\nit's a very visual story , and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles . \\nthis is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie , who shot the film in a dreamy haze , and the lead performance by rampling . \\nrampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie , you connect with her character instantly , despite that she's delusional . \\nthe scenes where she interacts with her husband , who she still believes is alive , are heartbreaking . \\nshe can't quite get over him . \\nthey've been married for twenty-five years . \\nthe other actors , particularly jacques nolot , are excellent too . \\nthe sex in the film is rather unneeded , but compared to ozon's `criminal lovers' , it's the disney channel . \\nlikely to cause some discussion afterwards , `under the sand' is a fine movie going experience . \\nwhile it's hard to recommend as entertainment , it's a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss . \\nozon seems to ask what you would do , and that's certainly a hard question to answer . \\n\",\n",
       " b'if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don\\'t look particularly good because i\\'m doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it . \\nif that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : \" shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don\\'t have to . \" \\nbut i know that\\'s bunk-you\\'re going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say . \\nso i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie . \\nyou know the feeling , when you\\'re sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly . \\nsometimes i think that\\'s why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever . \\nadmit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies . \\nso do i . \\nso i saw \" supernova . \" \\ntruth be told , \" supernova \" wasn\\'t quite as bad as i thought it might be . \\nmaybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn\\'t started tinkering with the director\\'s ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed . \\nmaybe i\\'m becoming a softy . \\nin any case , i didn\\'t find \" supernova \" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe . \\nbut it\\'s still bad . \\nthe film takes place aboard the medical space vessel \" nightingale . \" \\nthe crew includes captain a . j . \\nmarley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) . \\nthere are some attempts at \" characterization , \" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) . \\ndon\\'t expect any more explanation , because you won\\'t get it . \\nanyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent . \\nduring the dimension jump ( i think that\\'s what it\\'s called , but don\\'t hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board . \\nhe calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with . \\nthen a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening . \\nhave you seen \" alien ? \" \\nhave you seen \" event horizon \" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? \\ngood . \\nthen you\\'ve seen \" supernova . \" \\npost-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either . \\nafter all , no one\\'s going to think for a second that troy won\\'t turn out to be a villain . \\nbut the bigger problem with \" supernova \" is that it can\\' t just stick to the simple plot it\\'s afforded . \\nnumerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it\\'s a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped . \\nwas there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? \\ndid the ship\\'s computer learn something about humanity ? \\nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? \\nand just what does the film\\'s title signify , if anything ? \\nas far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn\\'t developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . \\ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense . \\nfor some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . \\nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . \\nbassett and spader\\'s characters start off hating each other . \\nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they\\'re engaging in some hanky-panky . \\nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . \\nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . \\nthe most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! \\nfurthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . \\nmaybe that\\'s why the film\\'s title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . \\nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you\\'re seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . \\nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . \\npoint b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . \\ndoesn\\'t make sense . \\nsince i didn\\'t understand anything about these characters\\' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? \\nnot a whit . \\nit\\'s a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . \\nthey don\\'t find it . \\nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . \\nsexual tension ? \\nmore like constipation . \\nmaybe they\\'re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as \" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . \" \\nnot that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \\nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film\\'s biggest forehead-slapper . \\nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \\nhe\\' s awfully one-note , but it\\'s not as if he\\'s given any more notes to work with . \\nthe rest of the cast does even less . \\ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \\nphillips broods . \\ncruz flirts with the computer . \\nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn\\'t paying much attention by then . \\n \" supernova \" is pretty awful , but i\\'m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \\nthat\\'s it . \\nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you\\'ll probably hate it more than i will . \\neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven\\' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn\\'t going to save the film . \\nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? \\nit usually results in a bad movie , and that\\'s what \" supernova \" is . \\n',\n",
       " b'some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese\\'s raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the \\'80s . \\nsince there are still a number of \\'80s films that i haven\\'t seen , i don\\'t feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i\\'ll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level . \\nbio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account . \\nit\\'s rare that a movie with the moniker \" based on the life of ? \" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining . \\nraging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre . \\nthe picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the \\'40s and \\'50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen . \\nfor all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying . \\nhistorically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion\\'s share of the details culled from la motta\\'s own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage ) . \\nhowever , although la motta is credited as the movie\\'s \" consultant , \" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout . \\nthe la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage . \\nsex and violence are inextricably linked . \\nthe title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull . \\nin the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them . \\noutside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled . \\nthe two people who spar with him on life\\'s canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci ) . \\nthese are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses . \\nhe beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence . \\nraging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class . \\nover the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match . \\nmeanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife . \\nvicki becomes jake\\'s greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain . \\nhis own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him . \\nhence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother . \\n ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : \" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? \" ) \\nin the late \\'40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall . \\nhe does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing . \\ntwo years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray . \\nby the late \\'50s and early \\'60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine . \\nraging bull is the other side of rocky . \\nsylvester stallone\\'s tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 . \\nit won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production . \\nbut , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring . \\nwhile scorsese\\'s primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working . \\nrocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased . \\nthere\\'s little i can say here that hasn\\'t already said about de niro\\'s performance . \\nin a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding . \\nthe level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering . \\nand , although there\\'s a lot of travis bickle ( de niro\\'s character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him . \\nthis is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting . \\nas the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit . \\nas the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form . \\nhow many actors would go that far ? \\nthe best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance . \\ncathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) . \\ntheir portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro\\'s . \\npesci , who has basically re-created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother . \\nthe misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed . \\nbut , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it\\'s startling to behold . \\nmoriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake . \\nlater , she\\'s called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear . \\nscorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few \" home movie \" segments are in color ) . \\nthe choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black-and-white approach is almost unheard of . \\n ( one important recent exception , schindler\\'s list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . ) \\nin black-and-white ( especially considering scorsese\\'s choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing . \\nthere\\'s no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas . \\nduring fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta\\'s perspective . \\nscorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta\\'s loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown . \\nafter that , his career was all downhill . \\nyet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta\\'s future . \\nthe reason is obvious : scorsese isn\\'t as interested in boxing as he is in the character . \\nfollowing his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies . \\nwe see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self . \\nwho cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando\\'s speech from on the waterfront ? \\n ( \" i coulda been a contenda . \" ) \\nperhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the \\'80s . \\nand , if not , it\\'s certainly perilously close to the zenith . \\n',\n",
       " b'let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official ( and even unofficial ) james bond series . \\nit is so full of self-parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof . \\nan omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence , a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it\\'s difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie ) and the assassin of the title . \\na song with woefully terrible lyrics follows , and the rest of the movie is even worse . \\nthe plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule-the-world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s , but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin , francisco scaramanga ( christopher lee , putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie ) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore\\'s 007 . \\nthere is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis and a missing solar cell with 95% efficiency . \\nit\\'s as much of a mess as it sounds . \\nbond is \" helped \" in his task by mary goodnight ( ekland ) , whose character couldn\\'t possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo . \\nduring the course of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk , blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever . \\nmaud adams ( later to star in octopussy ) is a much more stronger and useful character , but she hardly features in the movie . \\nscaramanga\\'s lackey is a dwarf called nik-nak , who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series , serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures . \\nworse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie . \\nthere is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in ( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists -- another misguided attempt at humour ) . \\nthe solitary car chase might have been a highlight , but the \" action \" is interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff ( j . w . \\npepper , played by clifton james of live and let die \" fame \" ) yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window . \\nhe is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie . \\neven his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history , a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge -- could have been , except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print . \\non top of that debacle , the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga\\'s \" funhouse \" . \\nthe only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series ( the infinitely superior \" the spy who loved me \" ) a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive . \\n',\n",

\\nmeg ryan , america\\'s high school sweetheart , can act . \\nshe\\'s had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don\\'t , get the movie-- fantastic ) . \\nbut , i like her best when she\\'s , well , perky . \\nshe is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime . \\nsome people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don\\'t really know . \\nall i know is that i just like them both . \\nthey have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that\\'s really hard to resist , and i\\'m not going to even try . \\nthey\\'re just really , really cute , sweet , and charming . \\nhanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle . \\nhere , the setup is a little different . \\nkathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children\\'s bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her . \\nshe is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) . \\nshe is also having an affair , of sorts . \\nyou see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 . \\nthey have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is . \\nny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) . \\nfox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children\\'s bookseller named \" shop around the corner \" , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly . \\nevery morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight \" to the death ! ! \" . \\nit\\'s a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have . \\nit also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no \" let\\'s have sex tonight \" mantra , if you\\'ll excuse my bluntness . \\nthis is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love . \\nhmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan \" hook up \" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness . \\nyou know it\\'s going to happen , the question is now ? \\nthankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids . \\nit\\'s all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good . \\nhanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is . \\nhe is , i believe , america\\'s greatest actor . \\ndoes he show it here ?

       " b'a movie laced with a good blend of action , comedy , and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet , but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way , creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product . \\neighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters , blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed , minus half of its original duo ( the late john belushi ) and nearly all of its original charm . \\ndan aykroyd reprises his role ( as well as his co-writing credit ) as elwood blues , the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self-proclaimed \" mission from god \" along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago . \\nas we begin , elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother\\'s death in prison years ago . \\ncompletely on his own , elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood , only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away . \\nbut elwood isn\\'t completely without family . \\nit seems he has a half-brother of sorts - not a real brother mind you , just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo-father curtis ( cab calloway from the first film ) , who has also passed on . \\ndespite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) to do otherwise , elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band . \\nworking as a police commander , cabel chamberlain ( joe morton ) , has an immediate disliking for elwood , who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mother\\'s affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet . \\nfollowing elwood around is the lonely orphan buster ( j . \\nevan bonifant ) , who quickly learns to become a mini-elwood . \\nwhen bartender mighty mack mcteer ( john goodman ) joins the group , the blues brothers band is complete , and once again , the group travels the country , crashing cars , blowing things up , and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock . \\nmeanwhile , cab\\'s personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next-to-next-of-kin . \\n>from this point , the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between . \\nthose hoping for an interesting and/or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story . \\nonly the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours . \\nfor those people , it may be worth it , for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting , but when the story does intrude upon the festivities , the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes , musicians turned stiff actors , and the pointless 10-year- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing . \\nappearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin , james brown , eric clapton , and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film , but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors . \\nblues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really , really love this kind of music , you might kind of , sort of like this movie . \\nmany , many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny , and if you don\\'t have a passion for very deep blues/rock , you\\'ll be bored out of your skull . \\nmuch of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd\\'s self-serving vanity project , but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this , none of the excitement is passed on to the audience . \\nand seeing three guys in three-piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long . \\nunfortunately , those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film . \\n',\n",
       " b'after a rather disappointing \" mary railly \" , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise . \\nthis is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet , small budget comedy with a big heart . \\nin fact it\\'s not even a comedy . \\nit\\'s a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs . \\nbased on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby , ``high fidelity\\'\\' is a wry and likable story about a man\\'s quest for fulfillment and happiness . \\nrob gordon was a dj . \\nit seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life . \\nnow he owns championship vinyl , a little musical store , somewhere in new york . \\nwhen he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend , a gorgeous blond attorney , life suddenly looses every purpose . \\ndecimated , humiliated and on the verge of a mental ( and emotional ) breakdown , he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what\\'s right and what\\'s important . \\nhe starts \" categorizing \" life , dividing it into \" top 5 lists \" . \\nand the most important is the \" top 5 list \" over the most painful breakups of his life , starting with 5th grade , when he found his young girlfriend with another boy . \\nthough you might think that people change , grow more mature with age , it just doesn\\'t seem that way and all rob\\'s relationships were different versions of that first . \\nwhere did he go wrong ? \\nwas it he that screwed up ? \\nor maybe life just stinks ? \\nwhile he is lost in his own self-pity , he must think of the \" top 5 list \" over his needs for the future , find the right elements and mix his life together . \\nwith clever parallels to the cult of celebrity , music and with incredibly direct narration , it addresses the average audience member , in other words -- people like you and me . \\nalthough a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears , the director , the acting is equally important as the written word . \\nand here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned . \\nhe is simply superb . \\nit is as much his movie as it is frears\\' . \\nthe film would not be the same without him . \\ncusack -- whose character is sadder , wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony . \\nmost of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but cusack pulls it off . \\nhis interpretation feels so emotionally right , so incredibly realistic and precise that frears\\' message simply can\\'t be ignored or overseen . \\nthe other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job . \\nboth ______ and jack black are fabulous . \\neven catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts , not just looks beautiful . \\nhowever , the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob\\'s co-worker and friend dick . \\nthis is such an impressive achievement that it\\'s almost worth a oscar-nomination . \\nhe is simply a joy to behold . \\notherwise , everyone are in their place , and at the right time -- all part of frears\\' colorful blend . \\npretty much like edward norton\\'s \" keeping the faith \" , this film doesn\\'t follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it\\'s dramatic , tragic , sarcastic , comic and even cynical , but never bitter or angry . \\nit\\'s a little bit of everything , pretty much like life itself . \\nnothing seems unreal or staged . \\nit reflects reality as a mirror . \\nas you watch it , you go through the same emotional problems as the main character . \\nyou feel and think and reflect . \\nthis effect has become a rarity nowadays . \\nalthough it\\'s primarily about the perils of love , ``high fidelity\\'\\' is secondarily about pop music . \\nrob owns championship vinyl and his employees , timid dick ( todd louiso ) and overbearing barry ( jack black ) , are fellow music snobs . \\nmusic is the language in their lives , the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives . \\nand so does the movie . \\nit is as much a musical film as anything else , as rob\\'s journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments . \\nin the end , you have gained something while watching it . \\nit\\'s not the film of the century or even of the year . \\nit\\'s not an special effects extravaganza . \\nit doesn\\'t require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed . \\nit\\'s a small movie about the big things . \\nand even though it does not contain heavy philosophy , you feel as if you have experienced something of significance , and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time . \\n',\n",
       " b'whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask . \\ni have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow-up , as well as the even- numbered entries in the film series . \\nhowever , i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs . data . \\nsomewhere along the line , the \" star trek \" film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category , and star trek : generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction . \\nits production values may be high , but the writing is frequently appalling , and instead of a script has a collection of references , in-jokes and ill-defined characters . \\ngenerations opens in the late 23rd century , where members of the original enterprise crew , including captain james t . kirk ( william shatner ) , are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name . \\nno sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus , a mysterious ribbon of energy . \\namong those rescued from the nexus is long-lived alien dr . soran ( malcolm mcdowell ) , but he is none-too-pleased at being back in the real world . \\nseventy-eight years later , soran is still trying to get back to the nexus , and again encounters an enterprise , this one led by captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) . \\nsoran\\'s plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet , and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains . \\ni don\\'t think it is an insult to fans of \" star trek \" to suggest that to a certain extent , the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a \" trek \" film . \\nit\\'s about a chance to visit with old friends , and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered gravy . \\nbut even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent , and in generations that just doesn\\'t happen . \\ndata ( brent spiner ) is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing . \\nin the film\\'s major sub-plot , data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions , a chip he has had in his possession for over a year . \\nwhat is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step ? \\nhe doesn\\'t get a joke . \\nonce the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data\\'s new emotions , but the point is that he\\'s no longer the data we know . \\nif the rest of the \" next generation \" cast fares any better , it\\'s only because they\\'re on the screen so little that they\\'re simply window dressing . \\nbut then again , this story isn\\'t really about the new crew . \\nit\\'s about kirk and picard , the cowboy and the politician , sharing the screen . \\nthe huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away . \\nperhaps because he knows this is his last go-round in the part that made him a legend , shatner looks like he\\'s having the time of his life ; stewart , on the other hand , borders on the deferrential , and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast . \\nstewart\\'s edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount\\'s hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was : these are clearly the not ready for big screen players . \\nby contrast , the prologue which features scotty ( james doohan ) and chekhov ( walter koenig ) is the highlight of the film . \\nthese characters have become part of the popular mythology , and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress , it\\'s a moment of high energy . \\nonly thirty years of history can create a moment like that , and that\\'s time this new crew doesn\\'t have . \\nit certainly doesn\\'t help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again . \\nit\\'s also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition . \\ni wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the \" trek \" universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on . \\nand what a waste of malcolm mcdowell , who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession . \\nthere are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at , but to do so would be to ignore generations\\' major flaws . \\nhowever , i would like to make one recommendation : seatbelts . \\nnot just for the enterprise crew , although you\\'d think by the 24th century space travel wouldn\\'t involve rolling around on the floor during a battle . \\nno , i think the audience might need them more . \\nthis journey is one bumpy ride . \\n',\n",
       " b'i still can\\'t figure out why people went in droves to see this movie . \\nnow before you go assuming i\\'m some sort of high brow snob , who can\\'t appreciate a little dumb humor , let me say that i love cheap humor . \\ni thought there\\'s something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998 . \\nlow brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun , the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent , there is no humor component . \\ni wanted to like the waterboy , i really did . \\ni think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie . \\nactually , i smiled a couple of more times on top of that . \\nnot a great record for a 90-minute film . \\nthe problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies . \\nthose responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material . \\nnothing could be further from the truth , as matter of fact , sandler\\'s idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film . \\nit\\'s really a shame too , because this film had the potential to be very funny . \\ni personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian , it\\'s just that so far he hasn\\'t been able to find the right film to showcase his talents . \\nif his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons , my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live . \\nmost of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry . \\nsandler plays a 31-year-old , somewhat mentally challenged , waterboy for a college football team . \\nthe team\\'s somewhat mentally disturbed coach ( henry winkler ) realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pent-up rage , which , if harnessed properly , would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field . \\nyou can figure out the rest from here . \\nsandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star . \\nas i said , the film had a great deal of potential . \\nthe idea was a decent one , but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast . \\nall of whom are very good , just hamstrung by really , really , lousy material . \\neven sandler , annoying goofy voice and all , has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material . \\neven as unfunny as his character is , i still found myself rooting for him throughout the film . \\nbut it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about . \\nif their material had been just a bit better , this film could have been such a funny movie . \\nfairuza balk plays sandler\\'s leather-wearing biker-chick love interest and does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time . \\nwinkler is great as the coach who uses a \" coaching for dummies \" -style book to help him get through games . \\nthe real standout though , is kathy bates . \\neven with some of the worst material of her career to deal with , she is still a treat to watch in her role as sandler\\'s overprotective and overbearing mama . \\neven with the performances of bates and winkler , there is absolutely no way i would recommend this movie . \\nalthough i get the distinct impression that without them , this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me . \\nwhich is sad , because i can\\'t really put my finger on a particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became . \\nit\\'s obvious that those involved , specifically the actors , tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be a funny movie . \\nit\\'s just too bad that 99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat . \\n',\n",

\\nwell , maybe children . \\nokay , so you might say that this is a movie for children . \\nit\\'s not . \\nin the scenes where good fights evil , there\\'s a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they\\'re watching a cartoon . \\nso is the film for adults ? \\nif so , we probably don\\'t need to be bashed over the head to get the point . \\nwhy not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know ?

       " b'according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . \\neven worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . \\non the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . \\nthis film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . \\nthe film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . \\ninstead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . \\nalthough many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini\\'s fascist regime . \\namarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don\\'t like federico fellini\\'s work very much . \\nevery member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . \\ndistortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . \\nin the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . \\nafter the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn\\'t matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini\\'s childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \\nfellini\\'s views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \\neven the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \\ncharacters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta\\'s sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \\nevery now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie\\'s characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters\\' visions . \\nbecause of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \\neven the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini\\'s totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \\nwhen fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \\nunlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn\\'t care that much about politics . \\nlack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini\\'s humanistic approach to his characters . \\neach of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \\nfellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \\nbecause of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \\nfellini couldn\\'t produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \\nvignettes aren\\'t memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character\\'s fantasies . \\nfellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . \\neven the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . \\non the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . \\nthis atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini\\'s long-time associate nino rota . \\nhis amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . \\nthat music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art . \\n',\n",
       " b'not since oliver stone\\'s natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility . \\nwhile fincher\\'s films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997\\'s the game ) into something like a definitive statement . \\njack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia . \\non the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer . \\nhere he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia . \\nstrangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob\\'s breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy \" tourist \" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity . \\nlater , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life . \\none night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don\\'t ask-- you\\'ll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn\\'t feel good . \\nit is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison . \\nhe moves into tyler\\'s squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are \" don\\'t talk about fight club . \" \\narmed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees . \\nresentment creeps into jack\\'s heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla . \\nfunded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem . \\ntheir initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour . \\nit is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist . \\nit is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting . \\nit\\'s a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out . \\nfight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people . \\nin the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it . \\ni\\'ll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don\\'t spring up here and there , and i\\'ll be even more amazed if fincher isn\\'t vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone . \\nthey needn\\'t bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher\\'s elaborate attempt at a joke . \\ntyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization . \\nin this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won\\'t . \\nhopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won\\'t spoil the joke for the rest of us . \\n',\n",

's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material . \\nwhen howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . \\ndirector michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach's goldberg variations . \\nit's too much . \\nthere are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john's other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . \\nthis plot thread predictably leads to violence . \\nnot content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff's superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . \\nit's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . \\nin this regard , l . i . e . \\n ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . \\nhow often does real life work this way ? \\nto extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ? \\n\",\n",
       " b\"summer movies are , by nature , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money . \\nwild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follows much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies . \\nwill smith plays jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses . \\nhe is called by president grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing . \\nwest is paired up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind , named dr . loveless ( branagh , with a zany moustache . ) \\nbefore i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair , i'll give it a chance with the positives . \\nthere's a nice credit sequence , the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye , and the special effects are decent enough . \\nthere's also a pleasant soundtrack . \\nburied deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes . \\nand salma hayek pops up as the female interest , which is always nice to see . \\napart from these factors , though , nothing else in wild wild west works . \\nfirstly , there's little chemistry between smith and kline , who appears to be in it purely for the money . \\none would expect zingers passing between the two : none arise . \\nboth of them plod through the below standard plot , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end . \\nnot even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment : although he is over the top , the material doesn't present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy . \\ntherefore , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious . \\nthe only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek , who is given so little screen time it's embarrassing . \\nshe appears to be in the film to merely show off her body , and be ogled at by kline and smith . \\nher character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character . \\nthe 'humour' in the film is also very off . \\nwill smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black , here , not even smith could save the humour on display . \\nthe script largely boils down to insults that aren't very funny , and one-liners that barely raise a smirk . \\nit's also somewhat racist , although it doesn't intend to be , with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching , and actually says slavery is good to save himself . \\nit's not a funny scene , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably . \\nthe film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automatically unfunny , it isn't , but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness . \\nthere's also problems with the plot . \\njim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations , but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying , and rely purely on luck , rather than audience pleasing skill . \\nplot elements are introduced into the film , and then thrown away just as quickly . \\nthe main piece of the story , a 80 foot mechanical , steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive , but there's no particular reason why it should be built . \\nwhy not loveless build a great big tank , instead of an ungainly , fragile piece of machinery that's just begging to be blown up ? \\ndirector barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them , with some nice camera tricks , but even this is missing from this stilted affair . \\nwild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing , but not much of it is evident , making this film drag out even more . \\nit's a sad thing when _four_ ( credited ) screenwriters , a talented director and a willing star can't make a film work , and eventually wild wild west collapses under it's sexist , mildly racist , unfunny weight . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"well , what are you going to expect ? \\nit's a movie about a big snake that eats people . \\nthat's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more . \\ninstead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too . \\nanaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river . \\nled by anthropologists dr . steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives . \\nalong the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda . \\nto simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide . \\nif this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don't know what is . \\nat the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now . \\ni expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing . \\ncale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help . \\nthis minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake . \\nhowever , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle . \\nmost bad characters are either annoying or stupid . \\nin this movie , they're both . \\nsince this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it's hard to find someone to root for . \\nyou're supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else . \\nor maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else . \\nat times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake . \\nthere are no standout performances here . \\neveryone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters . \\neven voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason . \\nno matter , as in most monster movies , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway . \\nin most of the scenes , the snake is computer generated , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real . \\nhowever , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences . \\nsometimes , for example , the snake just moves too fast . \\nit catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall , for crying out loud . \\nthen there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters , and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly . \\nabsolutely ridiculous . \\na testimony to the film's bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film , where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is . \\nin a scene totally unrelated to anything else , we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther . \\nthe anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard , one of the panther's eyeballs pops out . \\neeeewwwww . \\nabove and beyond the sick factor , however , this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed . \\nin films like these , a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained . \\nif the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see , we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them . \\nto show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown . \\nin a case like that , the showdown just ends up being a letdown . \\nwhen i saw the snake for the first time , i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn't the real danger . \\nthis one was just a decoy , and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe . \\nno such luck . \\nokay , maybe anaconda is actually a decoy , and there's really a better movie waiting to make its debut . \\n\",\n",
       " b'slavery is bad . \\nafter hundreds of years , we\\'ve finally figured that one out . \\nthis almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg\\'s latest \" serious \" film . \\nduring the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa\\'s west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . \\nfifty-three of them are stuffed into the \" la amistad \" ( from a spanish word for \" friendship \" ) by their new spanish owners . \\nfreeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt . \\nafter killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think . \\ninstead the ship heads up the coast to the united states . \\nthe amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy . \\nthe legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property . \\nif they are property , who do they belong to ? \\ntheir masters ? \\nthe spanish government ? \\nsalvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? \\nthe us government ? \\nthe defendants are pawns in several games . \\nabolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause . \\ntheir lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees . \\nsouth carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states . \\npresident martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends . \\nwhen the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes . \\neven that doesn\\'t work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims . \\nat the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners . \\nthis little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america\\'s past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court . \\nthe slavery issue is easy pickin\\'s for spielberg . \\nmuch like his \" shindler\\'s list \" ( which followed \" jurassic park \" as this follows \" lost world \" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose . \\nnazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human . \\nit\\'s not hard to see who the bad guys are . \\nwithout that question to ponder , the director\\'s job is more difficult . \\nhe has to make the story interesting . \\nspielberg succeeds for the most part . \\nthe visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach . \\nwhere the movie falls down is a bit more subtle . \\nthere are very few _people_ in the tale . \\nin fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out . \\ntappan and joadson are \" abolitionists \" : symbols but not humans . \\nvan buren is a weak politician but nothing else . \\nthe rest of the \" slaves \" barely exist other than dressing for the set . \\nlike many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white . \\nthe film\\'s salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou . \\nthe former model\\'s first major role is a winner . \\nwithout speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog . \\nthe other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in \" nixon \" ) . \\nthe impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen . \\nthere are some other great moments . \\nespecially impressive are the african\\'s struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land . \\ntheir interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant . \\nas grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans . \\nmore humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film . \\n ( michael redman has written this column for a real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some 1998 films . ) \\n',\n",

       " b'it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable . \\nsomehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through . \\nset in the 1940\\'s , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil ) . \\nan orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr . wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st . cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help . \\nfiguring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr . larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics . \\nsoon homer is delivering babies like a professional . \\nhe refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just didn\\'t behave more responsibly . \\nlarch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer \" continues to have such high expectations of people . \" \\nsuch is the result of an insulated upbringing . \\nthough skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else . \\nhe finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it . \\nbefriending a young couple who had come to see dr . larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived . \\nthus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut\\'s wife ) a willing tutor . \\ntobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life\\'s questions . . . \\nmany of which he was unaware needed to be asked . \\nhe demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing . \\nmichael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world . \\ncalling them \" princes of maine , kings of new england \" in his ritualistic goodnight , mr . caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine . \\ndelroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr . rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins . \\ndirector lasse hallstrom ( what\\'s eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter . \\nregardless of one\\'s personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers . \\nthe title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers . \\nfiguring the rules didn\\'t apply to them since they didn\\'t have a hand in writing them , they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along . \\ndr . larch , in his own way , acts similarly . \\nthere is a danger in that line of reasoning . \\ngod has also given us a set of rules . \\nunlike the list posted in the cider house , god\\'s rules , if followed , promise us benefits beyond our imagination . \\nand yet , many continue to ignore his \" rules \" preferring to make up their own as they go through life . \\n \" trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding . \" \\nproverbs 3 : 5 [kjv] \\njust as a builder follows a designer\\'s blueprint or a conductor follows a composer\\'s score , why shouldn\\'t we follow the rules of life given to us by life\\'s architect for our own blessing ? \\n',\n",
       " b\"kevin smith is like a big kid . \\nhis humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile's . \\nhe grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books , having also written a few . \\nhe also has a cult following , mostly composed of teenagers , college students , and smith's own fellow adolescent-minded grownups . \\nsmith is hilarious in person and in writing , but when he tries to be earnest and moralize , that is when he goes wrong . \\nkevin smith is a better writer than director , and he'll be the first to tell you that . \\nthat might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy-handed . \\ngreat directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them . \\nthis was true in the overrated chasing amy , and it is true for dogma as well . \\nthat is not to say smith's message is a bad one . \\nin dogma , smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god's desires is superior to anyone else's . \\nbasically , dogmatism is bad . \\nchanging the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or not . \\nthis is not exactly a new message in movies ( see inherit the wind ) , but i have no problems with recycling old ones , particularly since dogma's protesters are proving smith's point . \\nsmith's own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book . \\nbut this is smith's personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc . ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns . \\nthe story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god , metatron ( alan rickman ) , to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels , bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death , loki ( matt damon ) . \\nalong the way , forgotten thirteenth apostle , rufus ( chris rock ) , stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek ) , and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethany's aid . \\nfallen muse , azrael ( jason lee ) , proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery . \\nthe logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith's points , and in itself , has little dramatic momentum . \\namong the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman , jesus was black , and the bible was written by a bunch of racist , misogynistic white men . \\nof course , kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself . \\nthey are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic . \\nsmith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie . \\nwhen harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes , smith thought it might give validation to protesters' claims that the film was sacrilegious , but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke . \\nthe film's humor is uneven . \\nsome parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance . \\nbut many of the film's jokes just bomb , as in virtually anything involving salma hayek's serendipity . \\nalso , some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away . \\nstill , smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace . \\namong the actors , fiorentino and rickman stand out by far . \\nfiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight . \\ndamon and affleck are fairly lackluster . \\nrock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith . \\nbut the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob , who recur in all of smith's movies , are much more in line with smith's brand of humor . \\nbud cort , george carlin , janeane garofalo , guinevere turner , and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances . \\n\",\n",

d development that somewhere between the two films , the once-linked laura and press stopped getting along . \\nwilliamson suffers the worst indignity . \\nhe tries his best to enliven the token african-american role , but how can anyone recite insulting , derivative lines such as \" i\\'m gonna get african on someone\\'s ass \" and not appear ridiculous ? \\nbut species ii\\'s worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work . \\nat least the original featured plenty to laugh at--unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker , and the sight of helgenberger\\'s character performing fellatio on madsen\\'s , for a start . \\nbut the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all , let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level . \\nfor all the blood and gore , nudity , and sex thrown in , species ii is , quite simply , a vapid bore . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" desperate measures \" was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer \\'97 . \\nfor some reason , it was delayed until hollywood\\'s traditional dumping ground : january . \\nnow that it\\'s out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it\\'s a simple yet highly entertaining film . \\nmichael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who\\'s bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia ) . \\nkeaton agrees to the transplant , only so he can attempt escape . \\nhe succeeds , in a plan that of course could only work in the movies . \\nthe police force is now trying to kill keaton , while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son . \\nthe film definately has it\\'s flaws . \\nthe plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare , but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status . \\nalso , after keaton\\'s escape , garcia\\'s captain barks at him \" how many men have to die to save your kid\\'s life ? \" \\nwhich the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark . \\nthe thing is , it\\'s a vaild point . \\nhow many people have to be needlessly crippled , burned , and killed just to save this one child ? \\nwhat\\'s the greater good here ? \\nmany lives or one life ? \\nif movies really had guts nowadays , i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia\\'s character . \\nplace him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else . \\nalas , movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience\\'s strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable . \\ndespite a few silly moments ( and one or two really stupid ones ) , the good things about \" desperate measures \" outnumber the bad . \\nthe main highlight would be keaton\\'s performance . \\nthe character could have easily been an overacting , scene chewing freak , but keaton underplays it nicely . \\nhe\\'s not as menacing as he was in \" pacific heights \" or even as menacing as he was in \" batman \" ( yes kids , batman used to be a dark character ) , but you certainly get the idea that he\\'s evil . \\neven the final scene of the film , which normally i would just hate , seems strangely appropriate for this film . \\nso much so that i didn\\'t mind it in the slightest . \\nand another bonus : the film takes place in san francisco , which usually means a car chase on those hills that you\\'ve seen a billion times before . \\nand for a moment , it looked as though it was about to happen . \\nbut it doesn\\'t , and that\\'s creative . \\n[r] \\n',\n",
       " b\"as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . \\nbut also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . \\nonce again , chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie , with no last name . \\nthis jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . \\nof course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . \\nother plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . \\nthe sole purpose of mr . nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . \\ndirector samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan's , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . \\nother impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw . \\nnone of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively . \\nbut the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ) . \\nfilmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker . \\nhopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before . \\n\",\n",

       " b'whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms . \\nhe made the west dirty in \" mccabe and mrs . miller \" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in \" the long goodbye \" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with \" popeye \" ( 1980 ) . \\nthe same holds true for his most recent film , \" the gingerbread man , \" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie . \\nby the time \" the gingerbread man \" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham . \\nthere\\'s no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o\\'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn\\'t feature a great showdown in a courtroom . \\ninstead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , \" the gingerbread man \" is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman\\'s trademark full-frontal female nudity . \\nthe central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham\\'s other lawyer heroes . \\nhe is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds . \\nrick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) . \\na reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn\\'t hard to surmise that rick\\'s womanizing had a large part in it . \\nwhenever he\\'s late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it\\'s because he\\'s been \" screwing around . \" \\nafter an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn\\'t lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses . \\nhe drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together . \\nrick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers . \\nit was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does \" weird \" stuff like that . \\nas another character puts it , dixon is \" a few beers short of six-pack . \" \\nrick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency . \\nhe succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory\\'s begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) . \\ndixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out . \\nfrom there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double-crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action . \\naltman\\'s cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look . \\nif it isn\\'t night-time , at least it\\'s raining . \\ngu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light . \\na great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability . \\nin the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world . \\naltman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies . \\nbut , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings . \\n \" the gingerbread man \" is no different , although his style is much more restrained here . \\nhowever , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller . \\na great deal of the credit for the film\\'s success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction . \\nhere , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic . \\nrick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . \\nwithout it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick\\'s pain and frustration . \\nthe supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart-breaking role as the jewish maid in \" schindler\\'s list \" ( 1993 ) . \\ntom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird . \\nit doesn\\'t seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film\\'s one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing . \\nwhile \" the gingerbread man \" isn\\'t in league with altman\\'s greatest works like \" nashville \" ( 1975 ) or \" the player \" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career . \\nsome critics love to stamp films like this as \" commercial , \" as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don\\'t make money . \\naltman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more . \\n',\n",
       " b'it seemed like the perfect concept . \\nwhat better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? \\nit\\'s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . \\njim carrey\\'s signed on too ? \\neven better . \\nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers\\' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as \" schizophrenia , \" and so forth . \\nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers\\' fire , proving that some people just couldn\\'t take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . \\nyes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn\\'t funny . \\nit\\'s not for lack of trying . \\nthe farrellys utilize in \" me , myself & irene \" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . \\nthis , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . \\nsoon enough , charlie\\'s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . \\nthis guy isn\\'t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he\\'s been insulted , or holding a little girl\\'s head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . \\nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . \\nsome have suggested that this isn\\'t a problem , because the farrelly brothers\\' brand of humor doesn\\'t require plot to work . \\nthey\\'re wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys\\' last effort , 1996\\'s \" there\\'s something about mary . \" \\n ( 1999\\'s \" outside providence \" was technically an earlier project . ) \\nthe brothers\\' earlier film wasn\\'t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . \\nin \" mary , \" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they\\'d have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . \\n \" me , myself & irene , \" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at \" mary \" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . \\nhaving been produced by the same guys who made \" mary , \" \" irene \" seems like an even bigger disappointment . \\nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . \\nbut they haven\\'t come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of \" me , myself & irene \" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . \\nthe plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who\\'s in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that\\'s entirely predictable from the get-go . \\n ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? \\nyeah , me too . ) \\nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \\ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \\nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \\ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \\nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \\nbut by the end of the film , they\\'re still doing the same schitck it hasn\\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\\'t been dropped either . \\nthat\\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \\n \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . \\nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\\'s actions . \\nthis doesn\\'t really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\\'s condition early on , so they don\\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \\nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn\\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \\njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" \\nit\\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \\ncarrey doesn\\'t pull any stunts we don\\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\\' script doesn\\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\\'t set up in any meaningful way . \\nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \\nzellweger\\'s irene is not a strong female lead mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \\nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \\nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . \\nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \\nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \\nafter viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \\nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \\nbut i don\\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \\nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\\'ll rebound just fine . \\neven after that happens , though , i\\'ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high-caliber misfire . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" payback , \" brian helgeland\\'s inauspicious directing debut ( coincidentally , he previously penned the award-winning screenplay for 1997\\'s \" l . a . confidential \" ) , is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea---a movie with non-stop violence , death , and villains---and runs with it , or should i say , barely manages to crawl away with it . \\nmel gibson , in yet another disappointing picture ( \" conspiracy theory \" and \" lethal weapon 4 , \" anyone ? ) , stars as the reprehensible villain/hero , porter , a man who becomes determined to get his 50% share of $140 , 000 , which he stole in a robbery , back when his partner-in-crime ( gregg henry ) and drug-addicted wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leave him for dead . \\nporter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay . \\nthe tagline for \" payback \" is , \" get ready to root for the bad guy , \" and sure enough , this is true , as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way . \\ni wouldn\\'t have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest , but it wasn\\'t , and therefore , i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever . \\nno attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters , and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them . \\njust because the protagonist , a \" bad guy , \" is played by mel gibson doesn\\'t mean i will \" root for him , \" and i didn\\'t . \\nquite the contrary , every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up the dull proceedings ) . \\nsince none of the respectable actors in \" payback \" actually have human beings to play , only one performance managed to stand out . \\nlucy alexis liu ( of t . v . \\'s \" ally mcbeal \" ) , who plays a spicy s&m dominatrix , brightens up every scene she is in , and has a definite flair for comedy , something i would have liked to have seen more of , since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat . \\nmeanwhile , gibson , who is perfectly fine here , sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging . \\nunger , who made an impression in 1997\\'s \" the game , \" is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback . \\nfinally , kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax , and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb ( tellingly , he didn\\'t appear in the original cut of the film , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later ) . \\nlike most action movies , the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking . \\nin the course of the 102-minute running time of \" payback , \" porter is shot three times in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer . \\nand guess what ? \\nnot only does he survive the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) , \\neven though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag . \\n \" payback \" is not , in any way , an entertaining film , even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on , but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen . \\nperhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours . \\n',\n",

       " b'it\\'s almost amusing to watch 21-year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter\\'s follow-up to 1997\\'s the tango lesson , the man who cried . \\nthe gen-y actress , with her cold stare and big , black eyes , has appeared in an impressive range of films ; but she doesn\\'t even come close to being the bold heroine the film , set against the historical backdrop of world war 2 , requires her to be . \\nricci , whose character is shockingly silent and blank , showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern , shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett : quite an amusing sight to behold . \\nblanchett\\'s lola , a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie , is bold , interesting and layered ? everything our heroine lacks . \\nco-star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy , blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci , sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe . \\nthe actress inhabits the role ? as she always so remarkably does ? with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film\\'s lead rather than her dull companion . \\nimportant historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film ; these landmarks serve as the film\\'s little conflict . \\nobviously , the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events , whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues . \\nthe man who cried has many aspirations , none of which come full circle by the film\\'s close . \\nthere are forced messages here and there : \" go forward ; always go forward , \" lola preaches to suzie ; there\\'s romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitler\\'s nazis , the gypsy cesar ( johnny depp , who , like ricci , barely gets to speak ) ; lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it ; and at the core of all these devices lies suzie\\'s desire to travel to america , where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago . \\nthe film\\'s main problem is that potter isn\\'t skilled enough to tell the epic-sized story of suzie . \\nthe time period\\'s instability , the conflicting social classes , the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life : serving as both writer and director , potter throws in some of each , but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any . \\nby the time the sigh-inducing climax hits , the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater . \\nthe film\\'s falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely ; are we really meant to believe any of this could happen ? \\ncontrastingly , in its moving final scene , the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film . \\nalthough it\\'s apparent that potter can\\'t grasp what she reaches , i\\'m puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place . \\nricci\\'s suzie is meant to be the film\\'s core : from the extended flashback at the film\\'s beginning to the quickly drawn ending , everything seen in the film , in some way , relates to her . \\nso why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals ? \\nthe character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble , but not present enough for the film to be ricci\\'s . \\nthe almost constant lack of flow and one-note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny\\'s beautiful cinematography that renders the film\\'s various locations wonderfully . \\nalso worthy of note are lindy hemming\\'s costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely . \\nand then there\\'s the music . \\nfrom minute one to minute ninety-seven , there\\'s hardly a moment when the wavering , skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don\\'t undercut the action ; the notes stricken both overwhelm ( particularly john turturro , portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio , whose money and reputation catch lola\\'s interest ) and accompany ( oftentimes , the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the film\\'s characters and reinforce that state ) . \\npotter obviously cares much about each and every musical note ; unfortunately , the same effort isn\\'t given towards ( almost ) everything else . \\n',\n",

\\nafter being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he\\'ll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion . \\nand like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people . \\nthe agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from \" romeo + juliet \" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of \\'97 ) who\\'s in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever . \\nsoon , he\\'s out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him . \\nthere are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on . \\nthe film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue . \\nsure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register . \\nthe film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one . \\nit doesn\\'t help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances . \\nthe script of \" the jackal \" is a complete mess , mostly because it can\\'t decide what it wants to focus on . \\nis this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? \\nis it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who\\'s in everything for the money ? \\nor is it a combination of both ? \\n \" the jackal \" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . \\nthe connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . \\nthe worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then . \\nthe supporting characters are worse . \\nsidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . \\nwhat is poitier doing here ? \\nhe\\'s one of the best living actors ! \\ndoes he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? \\ndiane venora\\'s russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade . \\nit\\'s not that anyone\\'s bad here ; it\\'s that they have nothing to do . \\nthe plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . \\nthe jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . \\nthere are several times where he\\'s in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . \\ntake a scene where he\\'s being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . \\ndoesn\\'t killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ?

       " b'in the wake of the smashing success of \" rumble in the bronx , \" it\\'s looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release . \\nrumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii . \\nthe version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it\\'s widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days . \\navailability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng . \\nthe subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small . \\nalthough the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you\\'re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it . \\nto be fair , i must admit that i\\'ve never been very fond of \" period-piece \" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past . \\nperhaps it\\'s because most of those i\\'ve seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it\\'s because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant . \\nin fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end . \\nor , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts . \\nhaving said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i\\'ve seen , and i quite enjoyed it . \\nsurprised ? \\nwell , so was i . \\ndrunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . \\nwhere he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong\\'s practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . \\napparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i\\'ve heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i\\'ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . \\none of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the \" once upon a time in china \" movies , but i have not yet seen those . \\nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you\\'re watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren\\'t expecting something on the order of \" war and peace \" . \\nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china\\'s cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . \\nhowever , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong\\'s perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . \\nthe macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . \\nin the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . \\nin the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . \\nafter fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners\\' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general\\'s son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . \\nand so it goes . \\nand the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong\\'s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i\\'ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . \\nlet\\'s move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the \\naction . \\nthere\\'s plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of \\ncourse , in a kung fu film , that\\'s to be expected . \\nhowever , this isn\\'t just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . \\nthe primary martial arts \" style \" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . \\nfurther , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but \\nthere\\'s a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . \\nunder normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . \\nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i\\'ll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . \\nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . \\neven without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . \\namong other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . \\n ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) \\nunlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . \\ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( \" a better tomorrow \" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the \" heroic trio \" series , \" rumble in the bronx \" ) . \\nthe performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . \\nthe scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong\\'s father\\'s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong\\'s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband\\'s anger away from fei-hong ) . \\njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he\\'s in fine form all through drunken master ii . \\nas far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . \\nit\\'s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . \\nthe picture is crisp and clear . \\none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i\\'ve ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . \\n ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) \\nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . \\ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of \" period piece \" kung fu movies , and it\\'s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . \\nthe plot does meander a bit , but that\\'s to be expected in this type of film . \\nif you like this kind of movie , you\\'ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . \\nif nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . \\n',\n",
       " b'it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k : tm . \\nhe had never seen any episodes of the show , and i have watched a scant few , due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes . \\nfor those of you not familiar with the premise , dr clayton forrester ( beaulieu ) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public . \\nto achieve this , he ( in the words of the tv series\\' theme , which is missing in the movie ) \" bumped [mike nelson ( nelson ) ] on the noggin and then shot him into space \" , and is monitoring nelson\\'s reactions to the movies he is forced to endure . \\nrather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies , nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions , tom servo and crow t . robot . \\nthe format of the show consists of nelson , servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched , and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love , the ship on which our heroes are marooned . \\nonly two things are different in the movie : the absence of forrester\\'s sidekick , tv\\'s frank , and the slower pace of the jokes . \\nthis latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke . \\nfor their big screen outing , the producers have chosen \" this island earth \" , a 1954 classic , and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill . \\nunfortunately for that film ( but making it ideal mst3k fodder ) , acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which , by today\\'s standards , are less than impressive . \\nnelson & co . make jokes about everything from japan\\'s dominance in the world market , to star trek , to the state of disrepair of seattle\\'s kingdome , and most of them work . \\nunfortunately , the segments set outside the satellite\\'s movie theater seem out of place and aren\\'t particularly funny , but at least they\\'re fairly short . \\nthe big question about this movie though is : why ? \\ni presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series ( rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago ) , but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen -- there are no special effects to dazzle you , no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat , and no use of digital surround sound . \\nso , it seems pointless to spend $8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for $3 , and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts . \\nnevertheless , mst3k : tm provides more laugh-out-loud opportunities than any film you\\'re going to see this year , and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse . \\ngiven its uniqueness , i hesitate to grade it against other films , but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of \" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b-movies \" it does well . \\n',\n",
       " b'the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man\\'s life , especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances . \\nthematically in cinema , love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters ; it is rare , however , for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni\\'s neo-classic drama , life is beautiful . \\nthrough a central cast of father , mother , and son , benigni demonstrates the wonderful , undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times . \\nlife * is * beautiful for guido orefice ( roberto benigni , directing himself here for the sixth time in his career ) , an italian jew , master con man , and aspiring waiter extraordinaire . \\nliving in 1930\\'s italy , he lives a carefree life of good fortune ; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . \\nalthough dora is already engaged , guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead ; the two have a child named joshua ( giorgio cantarini ) . \\nunfortunately for the happy family , the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps . \\nit is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie\\'s theme of family love becomes the strongest . \\nalthough prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm , he relaxes the role to ensure his son\\'s happiness . \\nnow , instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora , he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right . \\nbenigni\\'s performance is truly a well-rounded one , and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year . \\nthe supports are all strong as well , but the movie truly excels in its script . \\nlife is beautiful is a self-proclaimed fable , one which tells its story in grand , two-part fashion . \\nin certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a \" saturday night live \" spinoff -- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movie\\'s second half the script\\'s circular nature becomes admirably obvious . \\ncharacters make reprise appearances in fine form , and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot\\'s outcome . \\nin all , fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture , and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see their first \" artsy \" film . \\nlife is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone , and above all is a fine thematic picture . \\n',\n",

       " b'if there\\'s one thing i just can\\'t stand , it\\'s a film that oozes with sentimentality . \\nhere\\'s a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . \\nswelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless . \\nalas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up . \\nwhat reminded me was that i wasn\\'t choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter . \\nmy giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word \" cute \" but i\\'ve chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a \" cute \" film here ) . \\nit takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience . \\nmaybe it will work for some people . \\nit didn\\'t work for me . \\nbilly crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania . \\nhe\\'s in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film . \\nthe screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall . \\nhis name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he\\'d be a great movie star because of his size . \\nsubplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he\\'s never around for them , so they move to chicago . \\nmax is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins . \\nsam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved . \\nsam is broke . \\nmax is dying . \\npass the kleenex . \\nmy giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny . \\nit has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself . \\nin one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn\\'t believe that he\\'s actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) . \\ncrystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he\\'s countered by a slew of jokes that aren\\'t funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes . \\nmuresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can\\'t act very well . \\nquinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents . \\nshe was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff . \\nhere , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent . \\nall of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre . \\nas my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings . \\nsam\\'s multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) . \\nlater , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam\\'s reunion with his family . \\nand some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) . \\nit\\'s icky . \\nit drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions . \\nmy giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film . \\nmore importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is . \\ninstead , it\\'s a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears . \\nand since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world . \\n',\n",

       " b'i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate , cuba\\'s oscar nominee for best foreign film , directed by tomas gutierrez alea ( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo-- \" memories of underdevelopment \" . \\ni saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late \\'70s ; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition . \\ni knew then that memorias was probably a state-sanctioned political missive , and now expect strawberry will follow suit . \\nfellow internetters , primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba ( soc . culture . cuba ) , have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs . \\ni have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line--it probably looks like political criticism , but it ain\\'t so . \\nhaving some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro\\'s repressiveness , i can\\'t conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution , and i can\\'t imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement . \\nas kids say these days , duh ! , the revolution\\'s current state needs no criticism ; its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident . \\nthe proper questions to put relate to castro\\'s legitimacy . \\ni bet the film takes castro\\'s power for granted , and that this or any other movie , produced under cuba\\'s state control , cannot question his right to run cuba\\'s political show ( ongoing now for more than 36 years ) . \\nthat\\'s why i just can\\'t believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime . \\nlet\\'s see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up . \\ni saw the film--twice . \\ni was right ; castro remained intact . \\nstrawberry negotiates the relationship between a young \" dialectic materialist , \" as he describes himself , and a homosexual photographer ( diego ) in 1979 cuba . \\nthe young man ( david ) is the son of peasants ; a symbol of the revolution\\'s reason for being . \\ngrateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education , he studies political science instead of literature , his avocation , because he perceives it is his duty . \\ntherein lies a likely unintended irony , since cuba has no need for political theoreticians . \\ncuba\\'s government is castro . \\ndiego\\'s lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life . \\nhe enjoys the finer things--tea , opera , art . \\nhe does not do \" voluntary work \" for the revolution . \\nhis small apartment is a sensual oasis . \\nthe moniker \" bourgeois \" figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie . \\nhowever , he is a \" revolucionario \" in his own way . \\nthe supporting roles are filled by : an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche ; david\\'s roommate , who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme ; david\\'s ex-girlfriend , who dumped him for another guy , yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband ; german , a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit , and who strikes a faustian pact with the government . \\ngutierrez alea and co-director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too . \\nheck , towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor . \\nhe really loves the revolution ( as supposedly does everybody else in cuba ) and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws . \\nreal criticism is missing though . \\nthis movie is political window dressing . \\nluis aguilar leon\\'s op . \\ned . \\npiece on fresa in the miami herald ( 10 march 1995 , at 21a ) did not color my judgment ; it presaged my intuition . \\naguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this film\\'s political angle best : like many artistic manifestations in cuba , strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment . \\nas art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes , the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept \" the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point , while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point . \" \\nalthough terrible propaganda , this is otherwise a fine film . \\n',\n",

       " b'wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you\\'re the victim of a frontal lobotomy . \\nthere is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group . \\nthis is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core . \\nwild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 . \\ni\\'ve seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch . \\nwild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it\\'s a thriller with a real story . \\nwhat it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists . \\neverything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie . \\nthe film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it . \\nusing this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once . \\nthat\\'s not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what\\'s around the next corner . \\nthe ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex . \\nboth have an abundance of screen time , although i\\'ll admit that the film\\'s erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected . \\nnothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ?

       " b'i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . \\ni spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . \\nthis was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . \\nthen marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups . \\nit certainly didn\\'t look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his \" last night of freedom . \" \\nben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this \\'till death do you part business . \\nthen , on an ill-fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah , ben meets sarah lewis ( sandra bullock ) , a free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her . \\nas transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he\\'s never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she\\'s never had . \\nforces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue . \\nben is an ideal role for affleck\\'s easy-going charm , and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation . \\nsandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping . \\nthe two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script\\'s apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely . \\nlively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification . \\nthe kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution . \\nforces of nature isn\\'t about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it\\'s about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it\\'s not what he thought it was . \\nlawrence\\'s script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense . \\nearlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine . \\nthough one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you\\'ll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom . \\nthat is , provided you\\'re not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes . \\nfor a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans . \\noccasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can\\'t find what\\'s underneath . \\na script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes\\' excesses can\\'t spoil this unique concoction . \\nforces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents . \\n',\n",

\" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have . \\nscenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning . \\nof course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling . \\nthe scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too . \\nthose are the scenes that make up \" metro , \" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality . \\nthe actor that i most enjoyed seeing in \" metro \" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation . \\nit was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius . \\nrapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit . \\ni hardly recognized him in \" metro , \" and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more . \\nthere are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices . \\nthe villain in \" metro \" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless . \\nhe is played by

magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others . \\nyet the stories and where they are going are all independent . \\nwhat is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized . \\neach story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve . \\nwhile the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene . \\nthen toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again . \\nit is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked . \\nthis creates some strange effects . \\nthe stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships . \\nthe strands have varying degrees of bizarre content . \\nwe have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends . \\nphil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal . \\npartridge\\'s young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason . \\nfrank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self-help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit-heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women\\'s lib . \\nofficer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place . \\njimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children\\'s tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h . macy ) . \\nthe film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily . \\neach story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story . \\nthe common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories . \\nthe film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event . \\nmagnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories . \\nit is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson\\'s company . \\njohn c . reilly seems to be a standard fixture . \\nparticularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight . \\nhere he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used . \\nas studies of characters these stories are each worth following . \\nas well-rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired . \\nbut the film is willing to do the unexpected

remember the unfortunate cow in twister . \\nsmaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are . \\nwhen the whirlwind is over water , animals near the surface , frequently fish and frogs , may suffer the same fate . \\nessentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind , held aloft by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere . \\nso while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in . \\nthe rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs . \\nit seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped . \\nit is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon . \\n ( frankly i have no idea on these points . ) \\notherwise the event was quite believable . \\nwhat we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano . \\nin the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 : 2 . \\n \" and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants . \" \\nhowever a rain of frogs , though it feels biblical , is most definitely not a biblical portent . \\nnote that the previous verse says \" and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall

       " b\"getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity . \\nthe film was directed by randal kleiser , who brought us such bubble-gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon . \\nbut thanks to kleiser's surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script , getting it right is a pleasantly quiet , moving , and memorable film--one geared strictly toward a sophisticated , adult audience . \\ngetting it right stars jesse birdsall ( emily lloyd's boyfriend in wish you were here ) as gavin , a painfully shy 31-year-old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who--gasp--is still a virgin . \\ngavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon , but expose him to a single 30-year-old beauty and he's a mess . \\nmuch to gavin's surprise , the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan ( lynn redgrave ) , a rich , married , and lonely 45-year-old . \\ngetting it right is the simple story of gavin's awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right ; that is , to find the right woman to fulfill his life . \\ngetting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in-depth character development . \\ngavin's self-conscious voice-over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche . \\nwe observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self-confident maturity . \\nbirdsall's superb , understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film ; he seems convincing and authentic throughout . \\nthe charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin's life . \\ndespite her limited screen time , redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin's middle-aged seducer . \\nfor a supporting character , joan is unusually and impressively complex , thanks in large part to redgrave's magnificent performance . \\ngavin is also pursued , or perhaps plagued , by minnie , the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat . \\nafter minnie and gavin meet at a party , she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life . \\nhelena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role , and sir john gielgud , with his tongue in his cheek , embodies the height of arrogance as her father . \\ngavin's eventual love-interest is jenny , the adorable twenty-year-old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon ; london stage actress jane horrocks' fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character . \\npeter cook , the great british satirist , appears briefly in the film as gavin's uptight employer . \\nthe scenes of gavin's home life with his parents are also a treat . \\ngavin's over-protective mother ( pat heywood ) , whom even woody allen would find overbearing , almost steals the movie . \\nher life seems limited to just two activities : treating gavin like a 10-year-old and preparing exotic but inedible meals , such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce . \\ngavin and his father's attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing . \\ngetting it right , for the most part , is very well-crafted , except for two minor shortcomings . \\nfirst , the movie is about 15 minutes too long , and consequently it loses momentum at times . \\nsecond , the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin's best friend , harry , and his unfaithful lover , winthrop . \\noverall , however , getting it right is quite memorable for its humor , depth , sophistication , and outstanding acting . \\ndirector kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard ( adapting her own highly acclaimed novel ) deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth , maturation , and self-discovery . \\n\",\n",

       " b'it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen , who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as \" raising arizona \" and \" the hudsucker proxy , \" made their feature film debut with \" blood simple , \" a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge , murder , and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas . \\nit bears some resemblance , story-wise , to the coens\\' recent \" fargo , \" but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here ; \" blood simple \" is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end . \\nthe premise of \" blood simple \" is really just a slight variation on the standard love-triangle/revenge scheme : sleazy bar owner julian marty ( dan hedaya ) hires a shifty private detective ( m . \\nemmet walsh ) to kill his wife abby ( frances mcdormand ) and her illicit lover ray ( john getz ) . \\nthings start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but , upon collecting the money , becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme . \\nto reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much , but what ensues is a series of bloody ( and i do mean bloody ) confrontations , each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening . \\nevery act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator\\'s eyes , but we , the audience , are made privy to the \" big picture \" and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person . \\nthis aspect of the story , along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality - one gets the sense that if guns and , in one case , shovels , were not available , some of these characters would claw each other to death - are the most effective components of the film . \\nthe coens might have done well to title the film \" fear and loathing in texas . \" \\nsome have labeled \" blood simple as a modern-day noir , but , while i am not an expert on either genre , it seems more like a horror movie than anything else . \\nthe coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters , and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one ( relatively ) innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive . \\nthat said , \" blood simple \" is a very good horror movie ; the fear and suspense here are genuine . \\nthe coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards , such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun , discharging it as it skitters across the floor , or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film . \\nthat said , \" blood simple \" is not exactly flawless . \\nfor one thing , the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times ; i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover ( or at least thought they did ) , but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder . \\nand although they at least didn ? t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife , the coens also aren\\'t quite immune to horror cliches ; they indulge in a prolonged dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it\\'s-only-a-dream scene that had me rolling my eyes . \\nthe film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film . \\n \" blood simple \" is not quite the masterpiece of neo-noir that many seem to think it is , but it\\'s a decent movie and it showcases the coens\\' ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but non-exploitative manner . \\ni would firmly recommend it to all \" coen-heads \" as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller . \\n',\n",

       " b'we all know the fate of \" child\\'s play , \" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell . \\nwith the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be \" bride of chucky \" - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ) , it\\'s kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about . \\nalas , the original \" child\\'s play \" actually isn\\'t that bad . \\neven seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasn\\'t the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don\\'t believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this isn\\'t a bad movie . \\nit\\'s not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don\\'t have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , \" i know what you did last summer \" has recently gone . \\nthe premise of \" child\\'s play \" is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid\\'s doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kid\\'s doll i\\'ve ever seen . \\nthe next day , a bum who\\'s stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday . \\nof course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up . \\nlike the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll , that being andy . \\nand soon enough , chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun , and people are discovering that chucky isn\\'t just a kiddie doll one by one . \\nthe idea is a neat one , ripe for lots of comic terror , and luckily it utlizes a lot of that . \\nit plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive , they tell people about it , but when he tries to prove themselves , chucky does nothing , and everyone thinks they\\'re crazy . \\nit plays with this , as well as the whole child-like thought that dolls and toys come to life , and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments . \\neven if there\\'s an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise , goes to investigate it , and finds nothing , but wait for the kicker a second later ! ) , \\nthere\\'s also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat , and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes , leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience . \\nthe ending is rather fun , as well , albeit a tad too drawn-out ( about four different endings , maybe five ) , and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line-up , making them easier to sympathize with . \\nif there\\'s one horrible thing about many horror films , it\\'s that the protagonists are morons who you can\\'t help but shout obscenities at , and for the most part , \" child\\'s play \" steers away from that . \\nand most of all , the chucky character is a good one , not just because he provides instant comic relief ( look ! \\nthat doll\\'s moving on its own ! ) , but because he\\'s a generally scary character . \\nif there\\'s anything really wrong with \" child\\'s play , \" it\\'s that it\\'s too trite and has too less self esteem . \\nat almost 90 minutes , \" child\\'s play \" features way too less to be a real classic of horror . \\nit throws itself into a simple three act set-up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it weren\\'t for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll . \\nif the film had more confidence in what it was presenting , it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism , which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film . . . which \\nisn\\'t necessarily a bad thing . \\nas such , \" child\\'s play \" is content to be just the short , typical horror film , but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasi-campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short , typical horror film . \\n',\n",

\\nmuch of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson\\'s book , and there are some priceless comic observations . \\nbut you\\'re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work . \\nthis brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong . \\ndepp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson\\'s dialogue . \\nin between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost . \\nwatching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see . \\nit\\'s interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over . \\nas much of a fan as i am of gilliam\\'s work , cox would have been the better choice . \\nsid and nancy , cox\\'s best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film . \\ngilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose . \\nwhat kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ? \\nit doesn\\'t try to be a cautionary tale , and it doesn\\'t work as broad comedy . \\nif he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film . \\nbut i don\\'t want to be too hard on it . \\nthere are some truly funny moments , and if you\\'re in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it . \\ni do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance - i guarantee it will enhance the effect . \\n',\n",
       " b'another formula \\'feel good\\' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like \" waking ned devine , \" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . \\nit is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . \\nthe strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . \\nthe film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . \\nbut its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . \\nits message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the \\'war on drugs\\' is about to be escalated into colombia . \\nthe drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america\\'s jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america\\'s drug usage and drug supply . \\nbillions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . \\neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . \\nthe film\\'s mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . \\nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . \\nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . \\nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . \\nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . \\nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband\\'s enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . \\nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . \\nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . \\neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . \\nher gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . \\nsince she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . \\nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . \\nfor grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . \\nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace\\'s greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can\\'t control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . \\nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn\\'t want matthew to end up in jail . \\nit is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . \\nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . \\nthe film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . \\nthings work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . \\nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . \\nthis \\'unhip\\' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . \\nummm !

       " b'jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off . \\nmaybe it\\'s a classic case of displacement : it\\'s easier to see jarvis\\' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife , rather than leigh\\'s films . \\nbut it\\'s worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don\\'t make for a guarantee of \\'authenticity\\' , let alone a good film . \\nit\\'s the triumph of secrets & lies , then , that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek \\'authenticity\\' and honesty in everyday lives . \\nfollowing her adopted mother\\'s funeral , hortense , a young black optometrist , sets out to find her birth mother , and is disturbed to find out that she is white . \\nit is cynthia , a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne . \\ncynthia\\'s younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages , largely because of his wife\\'s animosity towards her . \\nhortense calls up cynthia , who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her . \\nbut their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually . \\ncynthia invites hortense to come along to a party , which maurice is hosting . . . \\nsecrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one character puts it , \" best to tell the truth , isn\\'t it ? \\nthat way nobody gets hurt . \" . \\nbut if the film delivers much more than a trite message , it\\'s because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths , even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us . \\nhence , cynthia\\'s difficulty with acknowledging ( first to herself , then to others ) that hortense is her daughter . \\none of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever \" been with a black man \" , before a long-suppressed memory seizes her . \\nat the party , cynthia\\'s pretense that hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies , as agonizing as they are funny . \\nlittle lies seep into every corner , like maurice pretending that he\\'s \" just dropping by \" when he visits cynthia after much deliberation . \\nmaurice\\'s job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile , a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles . \\none of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs the photo to look \" as bad as possible \" to collect insurance money , yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars . \\nthere are occasionally hilarious moments , as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception , \" i\\'ve got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs \" ; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne , \" if you\\'ve got it , flaunt it , is what i say . \" \\nas played by brenda blethyn , cynthia comes close to being a caricature , with her nervous , somewhat disconnected way of talking . \\nbut she\\'s really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her , precisely because she\\'s so needy of love , perhaps . \\nindeed , the whole cast gives warmly rounded , detailed performances . \\nthe script was developed partly through improvisations , and the fusion of cast , script and director shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the same time , and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout . \\nin a very different way , but also using a long single shot , the scene of hortense and cynthia\\'s first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity , all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings . \\nthe film\\'s climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen-esque revelations , and everybody hugging each other - is the one thing that seems false about this film . \\nhowever , it\\'s a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character\\'s lives . \\nwhen cynthia says near the end , this is the life , innit ? , you get the sense that , following the cynicism of his last film naked , leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all , without comforting illusions . \\nthe flying inkpot\\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\n',\n",

       " b'while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general . \\nwords \" croatia \" and \" croatians \" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations . \\nthe rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth\\'s bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context . \\nin a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers\\' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise . \\nsame line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime . \\nthe movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe . \\nhis latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro . \\nshannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away . \\nafter being arrested and tortured by kimba\\'s secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) . \\nupon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d\\'etat against kimba . \\nshannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war . \\nthing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary . \\nit shouldn\\'t surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books . \\nthose plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman\\'s the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre . \\nthis one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires . \\nunlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work . \\nthe movie doesn\\'t try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda . \\nchristopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role . \\nhis performance in this film perhaps isn\\'t breathtaking , yet adequate . \\nhis notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the \" normal \" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends . \\nalthough the movie doesn\\'t lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken\\'s , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character . \\nhowever , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o\\'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon\\'s reluctant colleague . \\nthis was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director . \\nwith the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess . \\nluckily , the dogs of war had a good script . \\nirvin\\'s direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel . \\nthe only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places . \\nin the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes . \\nunfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn\\'t help . \\nbut , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama . \\n',\n",
       " b'often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into , the call of the oboe ( o toque do oboe ) is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray . \\nmany elements of the film are solid , and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know , but they simply don\\'t convert into a solid work . \\nalthough a setting is never established , it becomes apparent . \\nthe film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day . \\nthe community is a dull one , where every day is a downhill slide from the last . \\nover time , the people have taken to themselves . \\nthe town cinema is closed , no tourist has passed through in years , and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger . \\nso what happens when a \" tourist \" ( paolo betti ) does arrive one day ? \\nhe sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock . \\nit is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby . \\nwhen he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance , the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years . \\nit is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers , and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film , thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages . \\nthe woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner ( leticia vota ) who also happens to be engaged to the town\\'s police inspector , a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance\\'s involvement with this musician . \\nthe rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray . \\nit features a character who literally rises from his grave , a woman who has a phone conversation with god , and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character , to an almost humorous drunk . \\ntechnically , this film is a nightmare . \\nthe music score is poorly edited into the film , so it is often choppy , rough , and abrupt . \\nthe lighting is poor at best , which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes , and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words , and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases . \\nthis translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue , but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words . \\nin addition , the pace of the film seems uneven . \\nit opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one\\'s patience . \\nthe film then moves into a faster pace , that again slows towards the end , as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark . \\nthere was , however , potential for this film . \\nit is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music , and the re-unification of people . \\nthese are all topics that could easily fill a movie . \\nperhaps , if there were no freak show , and the technical aspects were to improve , there might just be a thing of beauty at the end . \\nmost importantly , though , the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren\\'t such a bore . \\nuntil then , there seems to be little more hope for this piece , than that boy has by simply crying out \" mommy \" while he wanders astray in a park . \\n',\n",
       " b\"keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi-accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival . \\non the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater . \\nthey need not have wasted their time . \\nthe movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor . \\nthere are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click . \\ni wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either . \\nkeep cool just isn't very funny . \\nthe prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii . \\nalthough the print made it , the assistant's luggage was lost . \\ntoo bad that story wasn't in the movie , because it got a big laugh . \\nqu ying , the film's female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments . \\nhowever , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms . ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast-paced , incredibly long tirade . \\nit was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film . \\nyou see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes . \\nat least that's the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving . \\ncinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another . \\nalthough some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying . \\nheadache , as i said . \\nthe film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying ) . \\nthey used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship . \\nthe first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back . \\nof course the thing is , she doesn't want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit . \\nin the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost . \\nwe later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced . \\nthere is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses . \\nthere is no sense to be made out of the young woman's behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character . \\nthe bookseller would be better off without her . \\nalthough the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner's hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man . \\nwhile the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation . \\nhis quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time . \\na friendship develops between the two men , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate . \\nalthough only an hour and a half in length , keep cool contains extraneous material . \\nthe whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out , since we don't see her from the midpoint on . \\na case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner , and would have saved us from the bookseller's boring pursuit during the first half . \\nbut of course , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour . \\nthere are a few things that keep cool does right . \\nas mentioned before , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good . \\nalthough it grows tiresome , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic , and represents the differences in thinking between generations . \\nin one scene , for example , the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across , but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted , and that it means something entirely different . \\nalso effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene , such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner . \\nthe nightclub owner is counting out money , slapping each bundle of currency on the table . \\nwith every shot of his hand , we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge . \\nunfortunately , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film's shortcomings , and weren't enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater . \\n\",\n",

       " b\"the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \\nthat's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized , all-encompassing plot . \\nsuch an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment . \\none need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent . \\nthe trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist . \\nyou will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less . \\nthose who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one-note dud that is big momma's house . \\nothers will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness . \\nlawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner , an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john ( paul giamatti ) . \\ndangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco ( terrence howard ) has escaped from prison , and the feds think he's headed for his former girlfriend and presumed-but-never-proved accomplice sherry ( nia long ) . \\nsherry , however , has fled with her son trent ( jascha washington ) , possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ( ella mitchell ) , better known as big momma . \\nindeed , sherry appears to be on her way , but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming . \\nthat leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows . \\nbig momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs . \\ndoubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman . \\nunfortunately , big momma's house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters . \\nsuspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other . \\nof course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma's house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny . \\nand it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul-tempered beast , while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry . \\nunfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma's explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) . \\nmartin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character . \\nhe's just big momma without the makeup on . \\ni won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film-makers . \\nthere are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) . \\ni'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way . \\nthe gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs . \\nits lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . \\nbig momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . \\nit's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \\n\",\n",

       " b'if anything , \" stigmata \" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another . \\nof the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst . \\ni suppose i should have seen this coming . \\nafter all , \" blair witch \" thoroughly creeped me out , \" sixth sense \" was mildly spooky , and then \" stir of echoes \" had its moments , but wasn\\'t anything i\\'d lose sleep over . \\nclearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping . \\nis it then any surprise that \" stigmata \" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? \\nno , not really . \\npatricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother . \\nas it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest . \\nthe priest\\'s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue . \\nfather kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue . \\nhis investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ . \\nfather kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie\\' s story , considering she\\'s an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on . \\nhe eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church . \\nas it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a \" fifth gospel \" before they were excommunicated . \\nthe new rupert wainwright music video . \\n . \\n . \\ni mean film \" stigmata \" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse . \\nindeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it\\'s only interesting for about five minutes . \\ni\\'m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school . \\nhis camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing . \\nwhat this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , \" see ? \\nlook at what i can do ! \\ni\\'m an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . \" \\nmaybe then he\\'d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) . \\nif there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn\\'t see it . \\njust when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever . \\narrrrrrrghhhh . \\n . \\n . \\nthen again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn\\'t bother me if \" stigmata \" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging . \\nthough wainwright\\'s vanity certainly doesn\\'t help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script . \\nwhere are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? \\ncase in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren\\'t given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her . \\nthe extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she\\'s kind of cute , so let\\'s start the bleeding ! \\nthe fact that she\\'s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn\\'t help , either . \\naccording to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? \\ngo clubbing ! \\nsure , that makes sense . \\narquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . \\nscenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . \\neven though frankie page\\'s life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . \\neven more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . \\nfather andrew\\'s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . \\nas for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , \" i\\'ll get you , my pretty , \" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . \\ntrust me , i\\'m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . \\nwhat\\'s worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . \\nfirst of all , the film doesn\\'t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? \\nhow come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? \\nactually , i\\'m not sure what frankie was posessed by . \\nsupposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . \\nwhich one is it ? \\nthe answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . \\nfurthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . \\nif you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you\\'ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . \\nthere\\'s nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . \\n \" stigmata\\'s \" religion is so off-base that it can\\'t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . \\nif they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . \\ni\\'m not catholic ; in fact , i don \\'t care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . \\nit\\'s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as \" stigmata \" does . \\nit\\' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . \\ni\\'m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . \\nmaybe it\\'s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . \\nthe initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . \\nlike so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . \\nso much is overdone in \" stigmata , \" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film\\'s ( many ) flaws . \\ni\\'m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering . \\nwhen we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . \\nthe dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and \" stigmata \" is it . \\n',\n",

       " b\"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nat the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere . \\nthis highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture . \\nand with good reason . \\nthis is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . \\nremarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin . \\n ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) \\numa thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . \\nunfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship . \\nat this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . \\nthe duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot . \\nwhen not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent . \\nif nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . \\nthe story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption . \\n ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) \\noverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . \\nthe avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it's all decidedly uncompelling . \\nmr . connery , who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . \\nat least it all looks good . \\nthis is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . \\nin particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . \\nthere are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . \\nby the time the film's climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . \\nnot coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . \\nit's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining . \\na crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies . \\nthere may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not . \\n\",\n",

       " b'seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic\\'s pass . \\n[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] \\nwar is a topic that can\\'t help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . \\nmovies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . \\nit\\'s easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . \\nforgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number . \\n \" saving private ryan \" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . \\nit proves there\\'s a huge difference between battling and killing . \\nthe film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory . \\nit\\'s world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . \\nspielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . \\ninstead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . \\nthere is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . \\n \" poor \" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . \\nthere is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . \\nwe don\\'t get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . \\nthe nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they\\'re there . \\nin the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn\\'t happen . \\nthe men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . \\nthey are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they\\'re shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . \\nperhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme . \\nthe film seems to rely on the audience\\'s sense of patriotism , that the american military is \" right \" and good and that the nazis are \" inherently evil . \" \\nthe battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage . \\ni have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn\\'t help but feel some sense of joy and relief . \\nto triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there\\'s nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened . \\none of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . \\nthe plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . \\ntom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . \\nhe\\'s never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . \\nhe doesn\\'t want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . \\nthe mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan . \\nthrough a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general\\'s attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each\\'s death simultaneously . \\nwhen they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . \\nit\\'s easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once . \\nbut finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , \" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . \" \\nthe saving of private ryan isn\\'t just a dramatic device , but a thematic one . \\nhis salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had . \\nwhen miller\\'s company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn\\'t so quick to shrug it off . \\nhe knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone\\'s sense of hope a reality . \\nthe mission to find ryan gives miller\\'s group a destination , but not direction . \\nalong the way many things happen to them , both good and bad . \\na few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . \\nthe act of killing itself becomes one of the film\\'s major philosophical metaphors . \\nthe soldiers don\\'t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . \\nunfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn\\'t want us to think these men are invincible . \\nin fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work . \\nalthough the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time . \\nwhether they\\'re arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable . \\nsure , there\\'s a zinger here and there , but war doesn\\'t change the fact boys will be boys . \\nif and when one dies we too can feel the loss , even though we hardly knew them . \\nthe final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous , violent battle sequence . \\nprivate ryan has been found , but facing four to one odds , can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ? \\nthat\\'s not a premise for thrills , it\\'s symbolic of everything the film has worked for . \\nit would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending , it ends

       " b'it was easy to fear the worst . \\nbegin with a classic 1960\\'s television series , add a big budget and an a-list star in the lead role , and stir . \\nscript , you ask ? \\nwho needs one , kid . . . \\nwe\\'ve got ourselves a formula . \\nthat was my fear : a bloated monster without any sense of direction . \\nthen , much to my amazement , everything that could possibly go wrong . . . \\ndidn\\'t . \\nthe fugitive is as lean , taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years . \\nunder the direction of andrew davis ( 1992\\'s under siege ) , the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go . \\nexpect box office to go through the roof , deservedly , and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones . \\nthe premise is a simple one . \\ndr . richard kimble ( harrison ford ) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer , a man with an artificial arm . \\nafter an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry , kimble finds himself on the run . \\nhis one goal : to find the one-armed man ( andreas katsulas ) before u . s . marshall sam gerard ( tommy lee jones ) finds him . \\nwhere the fugitive surprises the most is the script , by jeb stuart and david twohy . \\nin a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic , the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence , its attention to detail and its respect for the audience . \\nin an early sequence , kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard , slick back his hair and change into a lab coat . \\non his way out , a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn\\'t know is kimble to zip up his pants . \\nit\\'s a small moment , but it punches home the urgency of kimble\\'s situation , and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget . \\nlater , while trying to lose himself in a parade , kimble thinks to drop his overcoat , the most likely way he\\'d be recognized from behind . \\nit\\'s these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble\\'s tells gerard that he\\'s too smart to be caught , he may just be right . \\ncredit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators . \\nthe bus crash which allows kimble\\'s escape is a spectacular sequence , as is a leap from a dam into the water below . \\nthe action is crisp and brutal , and never romanticized . \\nspecial kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single-mindedness of the two leads . \\nand what a pair of performances those leads are . \\ntommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard , because he manages an incredibly challenging feat . \\nfor the first third of the film , there is really no * villain * per se ; kimble is on the run , and gerard is out to find him . \\nit would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent , vindictive inspector javert , but that never happens . \\ninstead jones plays him as a sharp , committed man who\\'s just doing his job , so that when he responds to kimble\\'s comment , \" i didn\\'t kill my wife , \" with a matter-of-fact , \" i don\\'t care , \" we know exactly what he means . \\nit\\'s not his job to determine guilt or innocence . \\nit\\'s his job to bring in a fugitive . \\nthis is a well- written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form . \\nthe only unfortunate thing about jones\\' stunning turn is that it\\'s likely to overshadow harrison ford , and that\\'s a shame . \\nfor his entire career , ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero . \\nhowever , he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble , always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence . \\nthe fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing , and ford is up to the task . \\nthis summer has been loaded with action/suspense films , and most of them have been doing brisk business . \\nhowever , it\\'s time for clint , sean , and various dinosaurs to step aside . \\nthe chase is on . \\nmy advice is to catch it . \\n',\n",

\\nother than director russ meyer\\'s predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie . \\nthat is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay . \\nafter watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face . \\nthis movie stinks out loud . \\nquite frankly , this movie deserves a . \\nbut there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny . \\nso i\\'m giving it a . \\nand maybe that is too generous . \\nright from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands . \\nnot only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform . \\ni had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene . \\nto be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film . \\nwith the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn\\'t have surprised me if the opening had never been explained . \\nso what is this movie about ? \\nyou ask . \\nlike it really matters . \\nok , here goes . \\nthis all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry . \\nonce there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn\\'t for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them . \\neverything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral . \\nthere are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing . \\n>from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here . \\nother than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have . \\nthe dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts . \\nmr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of \" hey man \" , \" dig \" and my all time favorite -- \" this is my happening , and it freaks me out \" . \\nnow i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? \\nebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue . \\nmaybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter . \\ni don\\'t know , but all the big words in the world wouldn\\'t be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting . \\nbut the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie . \\ni\\'ve seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey . \\nin fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries . \\nadd to the directing and writing the music in this movie . \\ni almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers . \\nthen we have the cast . \\nfirst lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band . \\nthis has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera . \\nsadly , his acting doesn\\'t come close to making up for his looks . \\nif you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn\\'t surprise you . \\nmeyer\\'s stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets . \\ndolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band . \\nand no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents . \\nand yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents . \\nsadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest . \\nhey , it a sexist movie , so i\\'m writing a sexist review . \\nthen we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members . \\nthis goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie . \\nmeyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all . \\nsure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows . \\non the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene . \\ni sound like i\\'m writing a review in a porn magazine . \\nbut hey , i\\'ll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked . \\nand since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey . \\nthe only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it . \\nunless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too . \\nand if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d\\'s -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet . \\nthis is a movie that should be avoided at all costs . \\nan even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls -- beware : this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense . \\nproceed with extreme caution . \\n',\n",

       " b'reflecting on \" bedazzled , \" a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser , one sinful thought remains in my mind . \\nif hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley ( who portrays the fiery demon ) , then use that pitchfork and point me the way . \\nwith her pouty lips , irresistible british accent , and wild display of haute couture , hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation . \\nit\\'s practically impossible to turn this beelzu-babe down . \\nher next target is elliot ( brendan fraser ) , a tech support geek who is clumsy , awkward , and just too eager to please . \\nto aptly picture him , you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring \" steve the copy guy \" who effortlessly irritated his co-workers with his unpolished social skills . \\neugene , thus , is loathed and feared by his co-workers , who do their best to stay out of his way . \\nyet , beyond his annoying mannerisms , he\\'s a lovable oaf . \\nhe wishes that he could get closer to allison ( frances o\\'connor ) , a co-worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him . \\nhowever , the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowball\\'s chance in hell . \\n \" dear god , \" he prays . \\n \" i would give anything to have that girl in my life . \" \\nguess who then shows up ? \\nshe makes an offer that is too hard to refuse . \\n \" seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul . \" \\nthere\\'s even an escape clause . \\nif elliot\\'s wish doesn\\'t go exactly the way he likes , he need only \\'beep\\' her ( one guess as to what the three-digit number is ) and he gets to start over . \\nthe remainder of the film consists of elliot\\'s various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth , power , fame and allison\\'s love . \\nbut when he makes sweeping statements such as \" i want to be very , very powerful and very , very rich and married to allison \" , he\\'ll soon learn that the devil is in the details . \\nfor example , ( and we\\'ve seen this several times in the trailers ) , he is granted his wish , but finds out that he\\'s a columbian drug lord and that allison , while married to him , has her eyes on someone else . \\napparently , the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul . \\nhis other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short-circuits his new life . \\nsoon , elliot wishes that he had never made that deal . \\ngiven the mischievous nature of the devil , \" bedazzled \" has many amusing moments . \\na lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance . \\nhe ably assumes various personas . \\nhis funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world . \\nallison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her . \\nhurley also heightens the humor quotient , especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one . \\nit\\'s clear that she\\'s having a good time with it all . \\nyet , while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes , they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story . \\nbut that would be playing with fire . \\nwhat they\\'ve got works , so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is . \\n',\n",
       " b'with many big-budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting . \\nthe fifth element , the abyss , and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting , writing , or both . \\nat first glance , the matrix , larry & andy wachowski\\'s sci-fi/kung-fu/shoot-em-up spectacular , looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high-concept bad movies , especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role . \\nbut despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue , the matrix works . \\nit\\'s an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout . \\nreeves plays neo , a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with \" trinity \" ( carrie-anne moss ) , a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks , a unseen , omniscient cult figure known as \" morpheus \" ( lawrence fishburne ) , and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell . \\nneo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems . \\nmoreover , he discovers that the grim , bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it . \\nneo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah , with grave doubts that he is actually \" the one \" prophesized to come and save the world . \\nreluctant or not , what follows is a mix of hong kong-style slow-motion shootouts , surreal dream sequences , high speed chases , and comic book kung-fu fights . \\nthe film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality . \\nhow exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind ? \\nand if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in , would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion ? \\nunfortunately , the matrix doesn\\'t provide many answers to the questions it raises , but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions , shoot-outs , and flying roundhouse kicks . \\nperhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving , who plays agent smith , the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix . \\nweaving\\'s stony appearance , deadpan voice , and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting , evil technological force that controls the matrix . \\nlike robert patrick as the shapeshifting t-1000 terminator in terminator 2 : judgement day , weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because , despite his power and seeming invincibility , he looks ordinary , even scrawny . \\nweaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence . \\nthe film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography . \\nit seems to be deliberately kitchy , with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors . \\nin a few scenes , the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny . \\njust seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring . \\nhowever , with the comic-book style and tone of the film , you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience . \\nthe matrix isn\\'t a classic . \\nits open-ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers . \\nit fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions . \\nit also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero - the kind of shmaltzy feel-good goo that most of the film avoids . \\nreportedly , the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel . \\nunfortunately , audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future . \\nthe matrix is an fun , enjoyable diversion , like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival . \\njust don\\'t be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry . \\n',\n",

       " b'while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks . \\nand , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year . \\nthe trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it\\'s a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you\\'ve seen the animated series on hbo you\\'ll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he\\'s been sent to hell . \\ntodd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else . \\nnot only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while . \\nevery character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student . \\nthe story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life . \\nal simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him . \\nthe next element in the film is the part when things go awry . \\nand as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al . \\nas the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene . \\ninevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away . \\nhence , jason\\'s mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world \" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil\\'s army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again . \\nso , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol\\' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife . \\ntime passes . \\nand now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . . \\nthis character is merely a poor man\\'s obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla . \\nnow the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil\\' vs evil . \\nand evil takes the cake , doubtlessly . \\njohn leguizamo\\'s deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film\\'s relief point . \\nall this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners . \\nand then there\\'s martin sheen . \\nwhichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . \\nhis selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent . \\nas the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot . \\nthis is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street . \\ni\\'d never thought i\\'d be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen\\'s career is in better shape . \\nspawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable . \\nfor most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better . \\nit constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie . \\ncontinually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made . \\nperhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry . \\nthe filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible . \\nthe quality of this film is abysmal and insulting . \\nit is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton\\'s batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act . \\nbut bruce wayne had human elements to him . \\nhe was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human . \\nthe character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he\\'s fatigued about being normal . \\nand as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary . \\nnone of this is present in spawn . \\nthe fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner\\'s . \\nas an example of this film\\'s vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic . \\nadmittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that\\'s when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . \\nit is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature . \\nbesides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn . \\nmovies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to . \\nand kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one . \\nchildren are

death of a prophet , \" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . \\npeck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . \\nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . \\nimages of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . \\njump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . \\na third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . \\nhis small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . \\nat a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . \\nas the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation\\'s first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . \\nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country\\'s vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . \\nlumumba won\\'t seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . \\nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . \\nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . \\nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . \\npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50\\'s and 60\\'s . \\n ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . \\nsome colonial masters were better than others . ) \\nthe effort involved in \" lumumba \" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . \\nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . \\nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . \\nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman\\'s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba\\'s life . \\nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . \\nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn\\'t embellish on a larger than life persona . \\nthe family side of patrice\\'s life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . \\ni know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . \\nthe story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . \\nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . \\nthe actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . \\nin true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . \\n \" lumumba \" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . \\nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything i\\'ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . \\n',\n",
       " b'the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride , and it\\'s sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics , both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year\\'s finest films . \\nso , naturally , when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found , this notion left me puzzled . \\nit is a rare thing for a children\\'s movie to be praised this highly , so wouldn\\'t you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly \" magical \" piece of work ? \\na tad bewildered , but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films , i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind , having great expectations for the film . \\nlooking back , i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater . \\nbelieve me ; i wanted to like babe : pig in the city . \\nthe plot seemed interesting enough ; after the events that took place in the original , babe the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon . \\nbut after a fateful encounter with a water well , arthur hogget ( james cromwell , who the movie could have used alot more of ) has been rendered bed-ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially . \\nthe only solution that his wife ( magda szubanski , going from delightfully charming to downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public ) . \\nproblem is , the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded \" city \" , a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion . \\nsetting the main plot in motion , mrs . hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals , despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels . \\nit is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters , the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright . \\nhere is where the film took a wrong turn . \\nup until this point , i had being having a rather enjoyable experience . \\nthe beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs . hogget is accused of smuggling drugs . \\nunfortunately , the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel , none of them being even one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe . \\nthe main topic of discussion surrounding babe : pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children , and i believe it is . \\nat one point , a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown . \\nat other times , we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs to mrs . hogget\\'s full cavity search at the airport . \\nin fact , the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing . \\nhowever , that is , as they say , neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway . \\nthe animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half , let alone entertain a child . \\nanother problem i found with the film was it\\'s sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story . \\nif you\\'re going to make a darker and more sinister sequel , fine . \\nit may not be my cup of tea , but at least it is a noble ambition . \\nbut to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs . hogget swinging from wall-to-wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls ? \\nit just didn\\'t feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining , and the same goes for the rest of the movie . \\n',\n",

       " b'the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one . \\nit\\'s 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his \" attorney \" dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) . \\nthese two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path . \\nduke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won . \\nhe leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference . \\nfear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs . \\nit doesn\\'t , even in the beginning--while the pair\\'s antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark . \\ndirector terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we\\'re laughing , we\\'re laughing at them rather than with them . \\nthey spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles . \\nthe black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it\\'s probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand . \\nall this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture . \\nthankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , \" riding the wave \" of something that seemed special and important . \\nnow it\\'s six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it . \\nmaterialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the \" american dream \" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever . \\nthe social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment . \\nin many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam\\'s most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements . \\nyet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance . \\nthe protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke\\'s world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations . \\nunlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo . \\nduring the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn\\'t seem to approve , doesn\\'t do anything to stop it either . \\nby the time this scene takes place , they don\\'t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . \\nduke seems to realize at some level that he\\'s become something he doesn\\'t like , but he\\'s either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . \\nthis film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . \\nwhile gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that . \\nthere\\'s plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the \\'60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren\\'t usually very pleasant . \\nunlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who\\'s given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs . \\nin its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it\\'s sad and regretful , but i think it\\'s also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism . \\nindeed , duke himself admits at one point that he\\'s never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them . \\ni\\'m not sure if he\\'s any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea . \\n',\n",

\\nwhat was once so powerful about labute\\'s work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic . \\nobviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty isn\\'t it . \\nhe clearly has little passion for what he\\'s doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn\\'t managed to transcend that ) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience . \\nnearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down , as the two are made to enact soft-boiled tarantino-esque dialogue . \\nthey evince little chemistry , with rock constantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that\\'s represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) . \\ni think rock is a great comic yet he hasn\\'t been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it\\'s like he\\'s doing the damn chris rock show . \\nsurprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks . \\nthat wide-open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty-year-old body . \\nit\\'s the best work she\\'s ever done . \\nfreeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it . \\nthe actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty\\'s , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality . \\nthat\\'s interesting but the movie doesn\\'t do anything with it other than crash land the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle . \\nthe film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie\\'s in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it\\'s parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing . \\nthe film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke . \\nbetty\\'s screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty wouldn\\'t make any progress in the film . \\nnurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim\\'s wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim\\'s girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ? a little too tidy , don\\'tcha think . \\nbetty has an interesting theme , though it doesn\\'t even seem aware of this . \\nthe current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way . \\nthis is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real-life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) . \\ninstead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the \\'80s than the \\'00s ) , the film simply uses betty\\'s delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b . no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation . \\n',\n",

' \\nin days , he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling , loincloth wearing , rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts . \\nby now , the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl . \\nthe media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travolta's labor of love is a piece of sci-fi drivel . \\nnumerous journals have called it an ill-conceived idea stemming from blind hubris , arrogance , and poor planning . \\nand after watching this movie , you'll wholeheartedly agree . \\nthis is a terrible film that is illogically constructed , tediously acted , and frequently begs the question : why was this ever made ? \\nat a price tag of $90 million , this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly , assuredly becoming `the avengers' of this summer . \\nboth films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity . \\nin addition to the universally pejorative reviews , there's another bizarre element to the `battlefield' saga . \\nthis film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta , who for over a decade , had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen . \\nthe controversy is that travolta is a scientologist , and `battlefield' is based on a 1982 novel by l . ron hubbard , the religion's late founder . \\nthis led some to believe that `battlefield earth' would amount to scientologist dogma , laden with subliminal messages . \\nbut the story is so poorly told that any message , subliminal or otherwise , is totally undetectable . \\nif the audience got anything out of this film , it was this : we are not too unlike the psychlo leader . \\nlike terl , the audience felt imprisoned , dreaded their situation , and looked for any opportunity to leave . \\ncould that be the scientology message ? \\n\",\n",

       " b\"i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick . \\ntake the professional , for example . \\nit boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions . \\nit's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension . \\nthe professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant . \\nthe professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated . \\none day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door . \\nher name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a . \\nagent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda's father tried to rip him off . \\nleon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother . \\nthe two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both . \\nwriter/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin . \\nthere is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting . \\nbut beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe . \\nthe relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop . \\nleon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies . \\njean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda . \\nnatalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either . \\nbesson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing . \\na silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag . \\ngary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch . \\nthere isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more . \\na more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way . \\nthere were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely . \\nbut besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing . \\nthis is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty . \\na great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact . \\n\",\n",
       " b'people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies . \\noften science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller . \\nin such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked . \\nbut , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic . \\nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman . \\nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits . \\nbut the right stuff film isn\\'t even fiction . \\nit was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program . \\nthe plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes . \\nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier . \\nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado . \\nbut one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records . \\nten years later , soviets have launched \" sputnik \" marking the beginning of the space age . \\nin order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space . \\nbest air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image . \\nin one of critics\\' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s . \\nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman\\'s film looks quite atypical for its time . \\nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life . \\nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker . \\nphilip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies . \\nthe right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking \" artsy \" projects . \\nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film . \\nthe plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . \\nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . \\nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . \\nsam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . \\non the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . \\nshepard\\'s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn . \\nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . \\nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard . \\nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots\\' wives . \\nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch . \\ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman\\'s superb direction . \\nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . \\nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . \\neverything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . \\nin that setting , it\\'s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . \\nbut the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and \" natural \" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . \\ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity . \\nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , \" mercury \" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . \\nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman\\'s superb use of poetic movie language . \\nediting is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) . \\nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . \\nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space . \\nanother fine contribution of this film is \" oscar \" -awarded musical score by bill conti ;

now we don\\'t see astronauts as heroes . \\nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . \\nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . \\nbut this film , sentimental reminder of the times \" when future began \" , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow \" mercury \" astronauts\\' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . \\nand even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema . \\n',\n",
       " b\"michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels , many of which are science fiction . \\nthe most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel . \\nso in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big-budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel . \\ncongo failed , and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better . \\nit a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good . \\nthe film is expensive , over one hundred million dollars ; is long , 133 minutes ; has a terrific cast , including dustin hoffman , samuel l . jackson , and sharon stone ; but has little that is really original and less that is exciting . \\nseveral years ago dr . norman goodman ( played by dustin hoffman ) was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered . \\nthe plan he wrote was only semi-serious , but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien . \\nnow that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes ( peter coyote ) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s . \\nsuddenly norman's less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft . \\nincluded in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , and astrophysicist ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) . \\ntogether they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets . \\none major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold-toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship . \\nwhat is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances . \\ndirector barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects . \\nthe problem here is he is making a big-budget science fiction film . \\nit has some effects , but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen . \\nthe technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer's imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting . \\nthat could be a reasonable approach in a low-budget film . \\nbut that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster . \\nit requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put , they don't . \\nhoffman's acting seems muted . \\njackson seems to laid back . \\nwe do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads . \\nlevinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance . \\nand why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody's guess . a \\ncast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price . \\nlook how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors . \\nmost science fiction spectaculars these days have second-tier actors and first-tier special effects . \\nlevinson tries second-tier effects , and first-tier actors , but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer . \\nperhaps sci-fi spectaculars are just not an actor's medium . \\nthe result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n\",\n",

engine * * * \\na strange mixture of _shine_ , _basquiat_ , _angel heart_ , and grant morrison & dave mckean\\'s graphic novel \" arkham asylum \" , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman-cum-detective who , on the morning of february 14th , discovers a \" valentine \" just outside his new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald\\'s strange fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree--a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch . \\nbelieving at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore ) . \\nhis minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard-trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police-woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he\\'s a nut , that doesn\\'t mean that he can\\'t solve a high-profile society murder . \\nevery moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a concept so \" high concept \" that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus\\'s \" caveman \" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane\\'s urban noir hero , spawn . \\nwith a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren\\'t inscribed with \" gotham pd . \" \\nthat being said , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . \\nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane\\'s spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . \\nit is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus\\' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . \\nwhether or not romulus of _the caveman\\'s valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . \\nit , along with m . night shyamalan\\'s _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller\\'s seminal \" the dark knight returns \" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . \\nreaders of sam keith\\'s brilliant \" the maxx \" comic series ( or of mtv\\'s short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . \\nthe failure of both \" the maxx \" tv show and of _the caveman\\'s valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america\\'s surprising contributions to dark fantasy . \\nluxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer\\'s ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . \\nkasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve\\'s bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . \\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . \\nclearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . \\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot\\'s rat\\'s alley wasteland . \\n',\n",

\\nbecause the script makes little attempt to properly develop them . \\nall the \" conflict \" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : \" jim , it\\'s too bad you can\\'t go on this mission because you were determined \\'psychologically inadequate\\' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together \" -- does anyone really talk like this ? \\ncan\\'t we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ? \\nthe whole film is like that . \\nthe filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what\\'s going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we\\'re looking at * every * time . \\nsample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : \" look , there\\'s mars \" astronaut b : \" you sure that\\'s mars ? \" \\nastronaut a : \" yeah , that\\'s mars all right . \" \\nastronaut c : \" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? \" \\nthat exchange isn\\'t actually in \" mission to mars , \" but i wouldn\\'t be surprised if it were . \\nfor all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven\\'t learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don\\'t tell . \\nde palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten . \\nthis is mentally-challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won\\'t get what\\'s going on , so they explain everything five times over . \\nfourth-graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted . \\nthe principal actors sleepwalk their way through \" mission to mars , \" never managing to do away with an apparent \" i\\'m just here to get a paycheck \" attitude . \\ncheadle stumbles over his awkward lines . \\narmin mueller-stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo . \\nrobbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard \" decent guy \" performance . \\nand sinise hams it up with \" wistful \" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub-par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then . \\nand of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in \" 2001 \" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world . \\nit could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy \" mission to mars , \" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow-going . \\nleisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of \" mission to mars \" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters . \\nsupposedly we\\'re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one-character-decides-not-to-return ending of \" armageddon \" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning . \\nme , i alternated between the two . \\nthere is only one good thing about the way \" mission to mars \" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over . \\n',\n",

       " b\"it's actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i : the phantom menace , because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy . \\nand no , i really don't feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the box-office . \\nreally , i don't . \\nnot at all . \\nthe plot has been done before -- a mysterious , unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town , causing confusion for everyone who reads it . \\nthe center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen ( kate capshaw , and by the way , what is it with bookstore owner main characters ? \\nin the past year and a half we've seen them in life is beautiful , you've got mail , this movie , and the upcoming notting hill ) , who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore . \\nshe immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from , and comes to the ( incorrect ) conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott . \\nhe , reading the letter himself , assumes that she wrote it for him . \\nafter a while , they fall in love ( well , duh ) . \\nkate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her , and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman ( tom selleck ) . \\nto add to her turmoil , her mother shows up ( blythe danner , who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about 9 ) and her trusted bookstore manager ( deadpan ellen degeneres ) quits . \\nsupporting characters aren't called supporting for nothing . \\ntheir purpose isn't just to move the plot along , they're also supposed to give the storyline a backbone . \\nto do this , they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting . \\nrarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed , dull , cardboard secondary characters , especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonist's various interactions with them . \\nthis is the love letter's damning error . \\ncapshaw's character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies , but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one-dimensional . \\nbecause of that , the love letter is awkward and insincere . \\neven worse -- it's a bore . \\ni liked capshaw and her helen , but everyone else is painfully fake , undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist . \\nthere is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either -- and besides degeneres' wisecracks , there's little that is even a little amusing . \\nthis is not a completely thoughtless film and director peter ho-sun chan does a good job of portraying helen's yearnings and various subtle complexities . \\nbut it's far from profound . \\nthere isn't a common theme running through the proceedings , thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless . \\nreally , this is a harmless little movie ; it's far from an abomination and it's not torturous to sit through . \\nbut bad , it is . \\nawful , it also is . \\nthe love letter is a failure , and an inane failure at that . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n\",\n",
       " b'capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence . \\nvisually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver\\'s travels and treat it as an action film . \\nthat makes it a film without much center . \\n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \\npierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire . \\nit reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver\\'s travels . \\nhumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift\\'s island of the houyhnhnms . \\nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet . \\nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that . \\nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish . \\nthe final irony of the original version has become film history . \\nwithout it there could never have been a \" planet of the apes \" film series . \\ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language . \\nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language . \\nthat could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking . \\nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film . \\njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending . \\nbut serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear . \\nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history . \\npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith\\'s best if not his best . \\nwhen the film\\'s success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s . \\nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases . \\nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 . \\nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again . \\nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton\\'s new version is even less faithful . \\nfirst , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes . \\nhe has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes . \\nthat could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes . \\nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring . \\nin 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world\\'s most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes . \\nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet . \\n ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . ) \\nhe quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks . \\nand the language they talk is earth- english . \\napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that . \\nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn\\'t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film . \\nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english . \\nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships . \\noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic . \\nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter . \\nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power . \\nshe is bent on making the world a better place . \\nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari . \\nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film . \\nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward . \\nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes . \\nthis is a further abandonment of the source material . \\nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each\\'s place in this reversed society , each important in the book . \\nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down . \\nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them . \\nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn . \\nthis is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in . \\nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win . \\nthe 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like \" i never met an ape i didn\\'t like , \" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character . \\nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals . \\nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog . \\nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup . \\nin general it seems much improved from 1968 . \\nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version . \\nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper . \\nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion . \\nchambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker . \\ntoday audiences have higher expectations ; baker\\'s visualization is really an improvement . \\nthese visuals work nicely . \\nwhat does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . \\nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \\napes spring incredible distances . \\nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost . \\none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up . \\nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up . \\nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti . \\nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes . \\nbut he delivers them very well . \\nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom . \\nas the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well . \\nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . \\nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov\\'s performance in spartacus . \\nas an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . \\ndanny elfman\\'s score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith\\'s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic . \\nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten . \\ni rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \\nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \\nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams\\' now infamous score . \\ndah-dum . \\nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \\nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \\nperhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . \\nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \\nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \\nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams\\' music . \\nhe\\'s building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark\\'s arrival is truly terrifying . \\nhe doesn\\'t let us get bored with the imagery . \\nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn\\'t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \\nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn\\'t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \\nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \\nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it\\'s a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . \\nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \\nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \\n \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \\nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it\\'s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . \\neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock\\'s \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \\nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \\nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \\nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \\nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \\nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what\\'s right and going against the entire town . \\n \" it\\'s your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . \\ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \\nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie\\'s captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \\nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \\nhe\\'s slightly deranged , and shaw\\'s performance is almost a caricature . \\nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \\nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \\nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \\nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \\nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \\nof course , we can\\'t leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind\\'s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \\na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . \\nevery one of spielberg\\'s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \\nthe shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \\nmany have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie\\'s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \\nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \\n',\n",

murray\\'s a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo\\'s case and flipping them off . \\nand don\\'t leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you\\'ll miss the film\\'s best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell . \\nspeaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in \" starship troopers . \" \\nmatt dillon flexes his sleepy-voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision . \\nneve campbell , lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig , gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio . \\nre-edited and toned down a bit , the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths . \\nbut what we\\'re given works well enough . \\n \" wild things \" is highly entertaining and , indeed , very wild . \\n',\n",

       " b\"i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work . \\nhe always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain . \\nwith teaching mrs . tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope . \\nwhat used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here . \\nthe components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to . \\nbut where are the thrills ? \\nthe laughs ? \\nboth are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge . \\nand what a shame that is . \\ni loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty . \\nkevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office . \\nteaching mrs . tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign . \\nor perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties . \\ni still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past . \\nthe title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren . \\nmrs . tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils . \\nthe principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members . \\ni enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way . \\nmirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink . \\nin other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work . \\nthe plot is a big problem here . \\nmaterial that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director . \\nthe likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship . \\nbut typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable . \\nlater on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs . tingle's final exam . \\nleigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it . \\nalas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning . \\nin the morning . . . \\nhow convenient ! \\nthe three students head to mrs . tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name . \\nthings get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle . \\nthe plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her . \\nof course , not everything goes entirely to plan . \\nbesides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress . \\nthere is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved . \\nthe humor is completely inconsistent . \\nafter many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze . \\nyou continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace . \\na moment like that never arises . \\nwilliamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players , including the talented mckean and larry sanders' vet tambor . \\nand the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely . \\non the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher . \\nwhile everything is pretty lifeless , teaching mrs . tingle remains watchable . \\nthere are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script . \\nmirren is easily the best reason to keep watching . \\nshe is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can't save individual scenes that flounder in boredom . \\nif there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be `disappointing' . \\nbasically , kevin williamson is his worst enemy here . \\nhis uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) . \\nwe will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real . \\n\",\n",

       " b'john boorman\\'s \" zardoz \" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own . \\nnot since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time . \\nof course , wood\\'s career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent . \\nboorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain \" zardoz \" ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful \" exorcist ii : the heretic \" ) . \\nboorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn\\'t know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent . \\nthis is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece \" deliverance \" ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama \" hope and glory \" ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic \" excalibur \" ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure \" the emerald forest \" ( 1985 ) . \\nhis films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste . \\nif boorman is anything , he\\'s ambitious , and when he succeeds , it\\'s in grand fashion . \\nunfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around . \\n \" zardoz \" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman\\'s . \\nhis screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even \" the wizard of oz , \" a book which figures into the movie\\'s plot . \\nbut , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling . \\nthe events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found . \\nin fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions . \\nit\\'s more middle ages than space age . \\nthe world of \" zardoz \" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life . \\nthese immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society . \\nhowever , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years . \\nif someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals . \\none of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed . \\nlike \" the wizard of oz , \" he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head . \\n ( this flying head is one of the movie\\'s opening images , and it\\'s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . ) \\ncalling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can\\'t procreate and take up more resources . \\nfrom inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , \" the gun is good . \\nthe penis is evil . \" \\nthat line alone is worth the movie\\'s cult following . \\none day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz\\'s flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex . \\nonce there , the immortals label him a \" brutal \" and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them . \\nthey seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up . \\ni say \" hilarious \" because that is exactly what \" zardoz \" is . \\nit is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn\\'t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming . \\njust looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker . \\nboorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of \" deliverance , \" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort . \\nhe attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( \" 2001 \" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in \" zardoz \" besides the inadvertent humor . \\nsean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace . \\nhe got exactly that in \" zardoz , \" and it\\'s a wonder it didn\\'t end his career . \\ni\\'m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements . \\nis it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ? \\nis it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ? \\nor is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ? \\nkarl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary . \\ncome to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip . \\npeople high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy . \\n',\n",

       " b'there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors . \\nwhen i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture . \\nyou see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries . \\ni hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories . \\ni hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac\\'s shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey . \\nthe badness of patch adams is stupefying . \\nit\\'s confounding . \\ni can\\'t believe a film can be this bad . \\nand yet , it\\'s based on a real man who probably has a good point to make . \\nin the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human . \\nin the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn\\'t want to kill himself . \\nwhile there , he notices that the doctors don\\'t care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings . \\nso , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients . \\nhe goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it\\'s good to help people . \\nhe also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor . \\nnaturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams . \\nso patch decides that he\\'s going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have . \\nand that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 . \\non a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn\\'t say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter\\'s performance , even if she is wasted ) . \\nbut the film fails fundamentally in execution . \\nevery scene swells with grand , \" emotional \" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard . \\ntake , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus . \\nwe don\\'t know patch yet , but there\\'s sad music , and it\\'s supposed to make us really sad that he\\'s sad . \\nlater on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . \\nand when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad . \\nbut the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions . \\nreal drama is character-based . \\nyou grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it . \\nwe don\\'t ever grow to know the dying patient ; he\\'s simply a vehicle for patch\\'s greatness . \\nreal drama doesn\\'t seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry . \\nthat\\'s why patch adams is not real drama . \\nit goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene . \\neven scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman\\'s sickening musical score . \\nsentimentality like this is indeed bad . \\nbut it\\'s not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes . \\nyou see , patch is a really great student . \\nhe aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he\\'s cheating . \\nbut patch doesn\\'t think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor . \\n \" why don\\'t we see patients until the third year ? \" he bursts out every three seconds . \\nwell , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . \\nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . \\nmost of us have to study . \\nand a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn\\'t know a toe from a finger , probably won\\'t be too successful in preventing death . \\noh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to \" prevent death , \" but to \" improve the quality of life ! \" \\nyes ! \\nthat is true ! \\nand you can not do that without studying . \\nyou can not do that without going to medical school . \\nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . \\nfollow the rules ? \\nbah ! \\nwho needs the rules ! \\nonly uptight doctors follow the rules . \\nthe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . \\nand then there\\'s the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . \\na free clinic . \\nin the middle of the forest . \\nwhere patients can be taken to be helped . \\nfor free . \\nhow will patients be transported to the free clinic ? \\nwill it have an emergency room ? \\nor is it just for mental patients ? \\nand who , may i ask , will pay for it ? \\nthe film does give some token attempts to question patch\\'s motives ( i think another character asks him how he\\'s going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don\\'t explore or challenge patch\\'s ideas to any meaningful extent . \\nreader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . \\ni know nothing about him . \\nif his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . \\nbut regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony . \\nand in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting . \\nactually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . \\nhe shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words . \\ni won\\'t tell you that you can\\'t be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words . \\ni was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be . \\npatch adams is the cheapest of them all . \\n',\n",

       " b'set in the late 80\\'s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie \" genre \" that ellis helped to create . \\nchristian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues . \\nit seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip . \\nas he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel . \\ni was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school . \\ni read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it . \\nas usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn\\'t end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore . \\ni picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers . \\nthe movie has a similar effect , but at least it\\'s less cryptic than ellis\\' novel . \\nfor once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on . \\nboth the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout . \\nthe movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman\\'s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does . \\nas a result , the film is immensely more entertaining . \\nlions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith\\'s catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference . \\nscreenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it . \\nsome cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable . \\nthankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut . \\nside note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman\\'s who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she\\'s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it . \\nthe ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian . \\nit\\'s a subtle in-joke and it\\'s one i found to be pretty humorous . \\ndespite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos . \\nthe real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman . \\nwhenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters . \\ni always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being . \\nto say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he\\'s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger . \\none sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news\\' song \" hip to be square \" right before burying an axe in a co-worker\\'s head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film . \\nside note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis\\' \" hip to be square \" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don\\'t expect to see them on the soundtrack release . \\nhuey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of \" stuck in the middle with you \" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release . \\ni\\'m assuming that collins requested the same . \\non a similar note , whitney houston\\'s cover of \" the greatest love of all \" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn\\'t the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source . \\napparently , houston wasn\\'t as open about the use of her song as the others were . \\na bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film\\'s release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film . \\ndon\\'t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more . \\nseveral web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i\\'m still undecided . \\nthere is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto . \\nthe scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) . \\ni kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off-balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) . \\nother than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman\\'s reality ) . \\ni think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as

       " b'i can\\'t recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . \\nfor forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . \\nthen , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . \\nfeeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . \\nfeeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him . \\nred\\'s punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d\\'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie\\'s dreams . \\nenter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam\\'s estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie\\'s eye and have sex with her in the bathroom . \\nunited in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn\\'t ready to let them go without a fight . \\nfreddie , meanwhile , isn\\'t ready to let sam\\'s money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations . \\nthere is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam\\'s intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father . \\nit does a great job of setting up jjaks\\' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves\\' wounded look is just right for jjaks . \\nthe wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . \\nmost important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements\\' \" i will dare \" on the car radio . \\nyou would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . \\nunfortunately , you would be dead wrong . \\ni suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn\\'t expect what i got . \\nwhat i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . \\nsuddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable . \\nthe sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . \\nvincent d\\'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . \\nthere are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme\\'s something wild and neil jordan\\'s the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn\\'t try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . \\ni don\\'t want to dismiss baigelman\\'s successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper . \\nit _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can\\'t make his two halves into a whole . \\nfeeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there\\'s not much funny about that . \\n',\n",

       " b'i must admit i\\'m going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend . \\nthe magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity . \\ni am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film . \\nmaybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy . \\nmaybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin . \\nbut maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life . \\nthe story of serendipity is simple . \\ntwo people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle . \\ncharmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink . \\nbut with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera . \\nsara declares that if this \" thing \" -- let\\'s just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future . \\nyears later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts . \\nwhat happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that \" thing \" was right after all . \\nfortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative . \\ncoupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity . \\nboth piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters \\non the flipside , films such as you\\'ve got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film\\'s main journey at hand . \\nbut it\\'s what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture . \\n',\n",

\\nis brilliant . \\nmars attacks ! \\nis based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer\\'s independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas . \\nbut unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! \\nhas a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it . \\nthe big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! \\nportrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are . \\nthe title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation . \\nthe spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman\\'s thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping . \\nit\\'s so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing . \\nthe movie lays low for the next 40 minutes . \\nwe get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple-sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming . \\nbut mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton . \\nit\\'s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton\\'s just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars . \\nanyone who comes to mars attacks ! \\nexpecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses . \\njack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer . rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr . strangelove\\'s buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house\\'s \" kennedy room , \" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big-haired , pointy-breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it\\'s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy . \\nsarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j . fox is her newsman husband . \\nthe octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , \" they blew up congress ! \" \\nand plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace . \\njim brown and tom jones are the film\\'s vegas-based heroes , and director barbet schroeder ( reversal of fortune ) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president . \\nalso on hand and underutilized are annette bening , pierce brosnan , pam grier , lukas haas and natalie portman ( the latter two also show up in woody allen\\'s everyone says i love you ) . \\nthe real stars , of course , are the computer-generated martians , and they\\'re fantastic . \\nwith bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull-faces , round egg-eyes with red pupils darting this way and that , these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate -- joe dante\\'s gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory , but burton\\'s little monsters are more inventive . \\nthe film\\'s raison d\\'etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans . \\nthe sheer level of mayhem is staggering , especially when the aliens make their first attack , blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons . \\nparents are urged to pay special attention to the pg-13 rating -- it\\'s earned . \\nthe special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy , and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day , although mars attacks ! \\nwas in production long before that film\\'s release . \\ncinematographer peter suschitzky , who makes the most of wynn thomas\\'s wildly imaginative production design ( thomas helped define the spike lee style ) , actually took time off from his mars attacks ! \\nregimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg . \\ncronenberg\\'s movie will almost certainly be more somber -- it won\\'t be released in the u . s . until early next year -- but mars attacks ! \\nis surely a similarly elegant nightmare . \\nthis is not a nice movie . \\n ( and which studio executive was duped into giving burton $70 million to make it ? ) \\nby setting the film\\'s final scenes in the nearly empty , holocaust-ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided , burton\\'s invasion epic suggests that the world we\\'ve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead . \\nthe victims of his invasion are naive , greedy , or disastrously self-absorbed -- and a good thing , too , since the movie\\'s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish-fulfillment fantasy . \\nthe surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers , who triumph by determining that the alien invaders -- the ultimate elitists -- are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture . \\nultimately , this messy masterpiece is the year\\'s funniest comedy and a weird , winking affirmation of the power of the people . \\n',\n",

       " b'after the press screening of \" moulin rouge , \" i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues . \\neveryone seemed a bit numb , understandable after sitting through a barrage of often-incongruous sounds and images . \\na pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it . \\nanother enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production , while a woman who flat-out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye . \\nwhen one fellow quietly stated \" i\\'ve never really been a fan of musicals , \" the statement surprised me because , even though the story is told almost completely through song , i didn\\'t think of it as a musical . \\nthere is so much going on in \" moulin rouge \" that \" musical \" seems too small a term to cover it . \\n \" moulin rouge \" is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o\\' adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience . \\naustralian director baz luhrmann , the man behind \" strictly ballroom \" and \" romeo + juliet , \" fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork , opulent imagery and songs ranging from \" the sound of music \" to \" smells like teen spirit . \" \\nsumptuous and beautiful , vulgar and overdone , \" moulin rogue \" travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the \" random \" setting . \\noh , and it has a story as well . \\n \" it was 1899 , the summer of love . . . \\n \" christian ( ewan mcgregor ) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris , \" to write about truth , beauty , freedom and love , \" where he encounters a group of bohemians , led by henri de toulouse-lautrec ( john leguizamo ) . \\nchristian meets satine ( nicole kidman ) , a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue , and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor . \\nat once fragile and vivacious , the dazzling red-haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying . \\nchristian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well , which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession . \\nworking with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler ( jim broadbent ) , christian writes an opus modestly named \" spectacular spectacular . \" \\nzidler quickly finds a backer , the wealthy duke of monroth ( richard roxburgh ) , but there\\'s a catch ?

       " b'if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell\\'s infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era\\'s heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . \\nso when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . \\nmy , how easily does the worm turn . \\nhype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . \\nat the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers\\'s last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . \\nand with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . \\nboring . \\nalthough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_\\'s lifelessness . \\n_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o\\'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . \\nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions . \\nin focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . \\nwith the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers\\' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club\\'s famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow\\'s feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she\\'s a peripheral character at best ) . \\nas such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . \\nwhat is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? \\neven whit stillman\\'s _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn\\'t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . \\ndancing isn\\'t the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher\\'s fault . \\nfrom what i\\'ve heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54\\'s legend . \\nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . \\naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane\\'s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . \\nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . \\nthis tacked-on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . \\nthey fail on both counts . \\nultimately , _54_\\'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . \\nas in , there isn\\'t any to be had for the audience . \\ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . \\nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . \\nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn\\'t get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film\\'s conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . \\nstrangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . \\nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . \\nthey\\'re on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . \\nthese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there\\'s still a great disco movie to be made . \\nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . \\n',\n",

\\nthen there\\'s \" caligula . \" \\nthis film features incest , necrophilia , beastuality , anal rape , homosexual felatio of both sexes , elaborate and lengthy orgies , a greased-up fist forced up a man\\'s rear , wine poured down a man who\\'s had his urinary tracts tied off , a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs , etc , etc , etc . this could very well be a respectable film , and if could have been had the following not occurred : a ) the events were graphically shot in clear view ; b ) the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to , well , show \" historical accuracy ; \" c ) the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets , a rather impressive cast , and a whopping 2 1/2 hour running time . \\nproduced and funded by none other than bob guccione , owner of penthouse magazine , \" caligula \" comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since \" plan 9 from outer space \" because underneath there\\'s a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified , but also brilliantly entertaining . \\nafter all , it\\'s not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry . \\nno film should be discarded because its content , because film is never about what it\\'s about , it\\'s about how it\\'s about ( as the old cliche goes ) . \\nthose who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with \" caligula , \" and that\\'s that it\\'s nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish , without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time . \\n \" caligula \" allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing . . . or \\nso i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons . \\nthe film opens on the wrong note , of course , with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen , using the over-used passage \" what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , \" depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( i suppose if one has to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place ) . \\nthe plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula ( disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell , a performance that does the opposite that his performance in \" a clockwork orange \" did ) is next in line for the throne but can\\'t wait for the current emporer , tiberius ( peter o\\' toole - ditto , only for his performance in \" lawrence of arabia \" ) , his grandfather , to die . . . so he kills him and ascends to the throne . \\nthen he abuses his position , marries a woman ( helen mirren , who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting ) so he doesn\\'t just have to sleep with his sister ( a dreadful teresa ann savoy , there to be pretty , naked , and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with ) , abuses his position a little more , a little more , and a little more , and then , i believe , invades england , then is killed off . \\nthe filler , instead of recounting his life , is supposed to be , as guccione claims , the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome , complete with orgies , vicious deaths , and lots of nudity . \\nbut instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be , it instead becomes guccione\\'s twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like . \\noh , isn\\'t it great that they just loved having sex ? \\nand that they killed people so disgustingly ? \\nand wouldn\\'t it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it\\'s so blatantly real bad porn that i\\'ve completely convinced myself that it\\'s not . \\ni mean , why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up . \\nand it\\'s not just that it\\'s disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it\\'s that in a film where the entire feel it\\'s going for isn\\'t felt , it\\'s also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time . \\nthe sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this . \\nbut that doesn\\'t matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just plain dark . \\nthe camera operation is also the worst i\\'ve ever seen in my entire life . \\nnot only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of focus . \\nthe editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow . \\nthere is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it\\'s \" adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? \" ) , but nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that i can\\'t in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face ( my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius : \" he could go at any moment , but with care , he could last a year or so . \" ) \\nthe music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian ( they use his gorgeous \" adagio of spartacus and phrygia , \" ad nauseum ) , used in an attempt to give the film some emotion , but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere . \\nthe orgy scenes ( and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo ) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself , which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment ( every five seconds or so , the film cuts to random nudity , as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated \" x \" ) . \\njohn gielgud represents the only voice of sanity , walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra , \" i\\'m going to kill my agent , i\\'m going to kill my agent . . . \" \\nand so on and so on , for over 2 1/2 hours , making \" caligula \" about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying . \\nguccione , in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking , arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage . \\nthroughout the entire film , the presence of guccione is easily felt , as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen , pretentiously looking down upon us saying \" look what i can get away with ! \\nand if you don\\'t like this , then you\\'re a prig , and worse than that , you know nothing about history ! \" \\nuh huh . \\nthere\\'s a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that\\'s artistically good . \\na film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last - that would probably make for a good film . \\nbut using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgusting-for-disgustingness\\'-sake acts is total , total bullshit , and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism , and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both , judging from this film . \\nthere\\'s a film that came out in 1989 called \" the cook , the thief , his wife , and her lover , \" a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway ( also starring helen mirren ) , which deals with graphic sex , heartstopping violence and gore , and even a little cannibalism for good measure . \\nthat film not only never patronized its viewers , but also handled them in a way that was shocking , yes , but also , in a bizarre way , entertaining and totally involving . \\nthere were real characters there in a real situation , and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that it\\'s going to be offensive to many . \\nthat film achieved everything it wanted to do , and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good . \\nand it\\'s everything \" caligula \" might have been but , alas , wasn\\'t . \\n',\n",
       " b'my first press screening of 1998 and already i\\'ve gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list . \\nwhat an auspicious beginning ! \\nwelcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . \\nfirestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves\\'s academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year\\'s crop of movies . \\nas our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are \" smokejumpers . \" \\nwe then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from \" cosmopolitan . \" \\nhaving the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . \\nwhen , even in the beginning , the director can\\'t get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble . \\nwith the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles . \\nnot bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people . \\nmiraculously , they manage to hear her and move away . \\nin a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building . \\nas it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl\\'s face . \\nour show\\'s two heroes , the crew\\'s chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl . \\nin a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames . \\nthe manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse . \\nthis mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make . \\nthe chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group . \\nwill it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica\\'s two firefighting buddies ? \\nshe has only seconds to decide who will be saved . \\nyes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway . \\nnot content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth\\'s screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape . \\n ( \" hoods in the woods , \" is what the \" ground-pounders \" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) \\nalong the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . \\nmost of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . \\nhe flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . \\narguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . \\nusing a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building\\'s attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . \\nwhen the film isn\\'t using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . \\neditor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . \\nthe ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . \\nperhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , \" it\\'s not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . \" \\nfirestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . \\nit is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . \\n',\n",
       " b'a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \\nfirst , there\\'s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \\nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \\nno no . . . \\njust kidding . \\nhad you going there for a moment , didn\\'t i ? \\nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \\nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it\\'s 5 billion inhabitants ) . \\nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \\nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \\nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \\ni\\'d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn\\'t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \\nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn\\'t try to overachieve . \\nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \\nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \\nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \\nshao khan has decided that he\\'s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \\nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \\none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \\ntoo bad they didn\\'t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \\ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \\n * the acting is truly bad . \\nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \\n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i\\'ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \\nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \\ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he\\'s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn\\'t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \\n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \\n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \\nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \\n . . . unless you\\'re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \\nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \\n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \\nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \\nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \\n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \\nsonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \\na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \\n * there aren\\'t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \\nsilly , silly folks . \\nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \\nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \\n * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" \\nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \\nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . \\nyou\\'ll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . \\n',\n",

       " b'there\\'s a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact . \\ni\\'d say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release . \\nthe early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes . \\ndeep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking . \\nthe repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there\\'s a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation\\'s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \\nthen we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense . \\nthe mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there\\'s a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation\\'s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \\nit goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail . \\nhow do we know this ? \\nbecause we\\'ve seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that \" the comet is still headed right for us \" and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading . \\nladies and gentlemen , that is the movie . \\nsuccessful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots . \\ntelevision is what\\'s wrong with deep impact . \\nthe main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that\\'s the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy . \\nshe thinks it\\'s an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area . \\nwhen she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps . \\n \" i know you\\'re just a reporter , but you used to be a human being . \" \\nshe figures out what\\'s really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet . \\nupon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question . \\nand everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you\\'re a star . \\nleoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet\\'s collision course with earth . \\nand i\\'m sure it\\'s comforting for her to know that , even though the world\\'s ending in a matter of months , she\\'s a cable news personality . \\nso there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up . \\nsuch personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out process . \\nbut as anyone who\\'s seen the commercials knows , the astronauts fail . \\nthey only end up breaking the comet into two pieces , which means even more destruction to the earth . \\nyeah , thanks , nasa . \\nthat\\'s when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren\\'t picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years . \\nthey even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave . \\nif the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed , deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie . \\ninstead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife , while people pack the highways out of town . \\nthe reasoning is , of course , that if a comet is going to strike , they might as well be out in some scenic rural location . \\nand , amusingly , the highway is spotted with people in u-haul trucks . \\ni\\'m sure it\\'s comforting to know that , even though the world\\'s ending in a matter of minutes , the u-haul people are doing the most business of their lives . \\n',\n",
       " b'a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today\\'s youth seem attracted to black culture . \\nthe review \\nif black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act . \\nhowever , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that . \\nblack & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america\\'s youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious . \\nfeaturing a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr . ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback\\'s is a complex film worth seeing . \\nblack & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman . \\nthere is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game . \\nthis eventually spills over into the life of dean\\'s long-time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem . \\nrich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white-owned club on his turf . \\nmeanwhile , the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr . ) . \\nothers who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will , joe pantoliano as his district attorney father , jared leto as a high school teacher , marla maples as the mother of one of hip-hop crazed teens , claudia schiffer as dean\\'s girlfriend , and mike tyson as . . . \\nmike tyson . \\nthe stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time . \\nfriendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence . \\noriginally rated nc-17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls . \\nwhile the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing . \\nthe three-way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for , and several audience members got up and left at that point . \\nthe frequent sex is one of the film\\'s few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film . \\nto toback\\'s credit , the level of violence in black & white is almost nil . \\nthese gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and concerns , and only become gun-toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way . \\nwhenever a character finds himself on donager\\'s handheld digital camera , he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence , but not everyone has fully bought into the idea . \\ncharlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop , but admits that \" in ten years time , i\\'ll be way over this . \" \\nthese youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it . \\ntoback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny . \\nmost of the humour comes from mike tyson , who provides the film\\'s comic relief without really trying . \\nhe is given big words like vernacular to say , and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson , he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better , playing on tyson\\'s image as a dimwit . \\nbut tyson also gets the film\\'s scariest moment . \\nas he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry , tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm . \\nthe scene is entirely improvised , with downey jr . being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction . \\nthe reaction he gets , being slapped and then choked is astonishing , as downey jr\\'s face turns a frightening shade of purple . \\nblack & white is a film about hip-hop culture , and the film\\'s omnipresent hip-hop soundtrack strongly supports this . \\nbut toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does , toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character\\'s struggle . \\nthus black & white\\'s message about hip-hop becomes secondary to the film itself . \\ntoback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip-hop along the way . \\nand we do . \\n',\n",

       " b'i think maybe it\\'s time for the batman series to be put to rest . \\nnot only has the first two films\\' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a \" superhero \" been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted third installment . \\nlet me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie , batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris o\\'donnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond . \\nmr . freeze\\'s thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick-handles it through the museum . \\ni might have expected this from an airplane-style farce , but i don\\'t think that\\'s what this movie is supposed to be . \\nafter all , the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero/action genre and kept the corny death-defying stunts to a minimum , while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony . \\nnot any more ; the list goes on and on in this one . \\nrobin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 , 000 feet high in the atmosphere , climbing in the door to save batman . \\nmr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond . \\na world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he-man cartoons . \\nmy very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl ( alicia silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs , during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her . \\nnot bad , but wouldn\\'t the police ( or maybe batman ? ) \\nnotice if the road was on fire ? \\ni knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place , but . \\n . \\n . \\n . \\nit also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment . \\nas if three protagonists and two villains weren\\'t enough , batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne\\'s butler alfred ( michael gough ) , which might have seemed poignant if it wasn\\'t surrounded by so much silliness , as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce\\'s girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie . \\nall this might be semi-excusable if the story were interesting and entertaining , but it isn\\'t . \\nin fact , it\\'s kind of boring . \\nmr . freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson\\'s joker and danny devito\\'s penguin . \\ntheir evil plot is as predictable ( schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words , \" today gotham city , tomorrow the world ! \" ) \\nas it is lame-brained ( didn\\'t it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too ? ) . \\nand robin\\'s constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bull-headed and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place . \\nstrip away the stars , the fancy set design , and the status as a \" batman movie , \" and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick . \\n',\n",

       " b\"one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel . \\nthat concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century . \\nhowever , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h . g . wells' novel the time machine , wasn't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences . \\nthe author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour . \\nwhatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages . \\ninstead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space . \\nthe novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration . \\nfirst of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own . \\nthe plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time . \\nat the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time . \\nthey are skeptical , but that doesn't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future . \\nat first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars . \\nfinally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions . \\nwhen he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines . \\nbut , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld . \\nthe time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times . \\nfor h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie . \\neven the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era . \\ncompared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films . \\nof course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness . \\nfor example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today . \\nsome of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing . \\nbut , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture . \\nthe acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george's trusted friend filby . \\nyvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role . \\nhowever , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science-fiction films sorely miss these days . \\n\",\n",

       " b\"all right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the best-selling story , speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin . \\nin fact , the script was in development well before 1992 . \\nstill , the comparisons are inevitable , until one realizes a critical difference . \\nno , it's not that the speechless twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting . \\nspeechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy . \\nspeechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign , where kevin vallick ( michael keaton ) and julia mann ( geena davis ) meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep . \\nwhat neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign : kevin is a sit-com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate's speeches , while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate . \\nat first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship , but eventually they let down their guard and become closer . \\nbut there are plent of obstacles in the way , including julia's stud-reporter fiance ( christopher reeve ) and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all's fair in love and politics . \\nthe standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they're crazy about each other . \\nscreenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other's arms in the first fifteen minutes , then developing the antagonism . \\nit's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work . \\npart of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already . \\nthere is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour . \\ninconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together . \\nthe problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass . \\ndavis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit . \\nin a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection . \\nfor the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines . \\nyou keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens . \\nperhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics . \\nthe setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for . \\nhe wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background . \\nit might as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be . \\ni was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king's previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hopes for speechless . \\nbut while there is wit in the words , this is a script which was probably much better on paper . \\non screen , it's still paper thin . \\n\",\n",

       " b\"in some respects , rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking . \\nthe hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone . \\nthe cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble . \\nall chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element . \\nthe duo must always be completely mismatched . \\nthe hero has to say some smart-assed comment before ( and after ) shooting someone . \\nhowever , that doesn't necessarily make for a bad film . \\nrush hour is jackie chan's first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector ( 1985 ) . \\nproving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ( ie : hong kong ) , jackie chan is given much more free reign than before . \\nstill , some die-hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed , as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes ( which he views as too short , according to one interview ) . \\nthis film takes a familiar theme of east meets west . \\njackie chan is lee , the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case , while chris tucker is carter , the loudmouthed , destructive cop that is `promoted' to the fbi to help him . \\nor , at least , so he thinks ( also another classic notion in action films : the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes ) . \\ndespite the necessary conventions of action films , rush hour is some of the most fun you'll spend and hour and forty minutes watching . \\njackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen , continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches . \\nchris tucker , familiar from his whiny , annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable , complementing jackie chan's straight-laced character . \\nhowever , jackie chan still maintains his comic-slapstick edge , as expected of him and his films . \\nperfectly downplaying the `fish-out-of-water' routine through his character's attempts at mixing into american culture , he makes up for the down time his character experiences . \\nwhen he is in action , however , you'll be amused and dazzled . \\nstill being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up ( in this case , a steering wheel , a serving tray , and a barstool ) , jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu . \\nchris tucker's character may come across as irritating , yet is also humorous . \\nsince he's not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan , he uses his main weapon : his mouth ( hence , the tagline , `fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west' ) . \\nwhile dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare , it is appropriate for the film and still very funny . \\nwhile not necessarily poignant , attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well . \\nlee's `knowledge' of american pop culture ( `that's the beach boys ! ' ) \\nwhen contrasted against carter's lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick , while carter teaches lee hip-hop dance moves . \\nwhile rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4 ( known in north america as supercop and jackie chan's first strike , respectively ) , it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr . nice guy . \\nwith its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs , it makes for a fun film . \\nas well , it is a true departure from jackie chan films , as it is missing one common element : a whiny female co-star . \\n\",\n",
       " b'with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the \" film noir \" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller\\'s crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) . \\ntheir latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . \\nthe main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn\\'t quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who\\'s wise to the world , but he doesn\\'t really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax . \\nthat main character is jeffrey \" the dude \" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film\\'s rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as \" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . \" \\nthe dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who\\'s in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody\\'s cheating in a bowling match ( \" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! \" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who\\'s always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( \" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! \" ) . \\nthese three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of \" hotel california \" and , if it\\'s possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . \\nif that doesn\\'t give you a good idea of this film\\'s absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude\\'s rug . \\nthey\\'ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . \\nthe dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn\\'t have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom . \\nunfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude\\'s car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money . \\nsoon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german \" nihilists \" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . \\nmeanwhile , the big lebowski\\'s daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . \\nthe plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc . \\nthe previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival\\'s \" run through the jungle , \" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . \\nthe film doesn\\'t feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens\\' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude\\'s dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . \\nthe film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this \" jungle \" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . \\nthere\\'s also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his \" this aggression will not stand \" speech . \\nthe coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( \" the bums will always lose ! \" \\nshouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their \" peaceful beach community , \" and so on . \\nby the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least \" aggression \" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on \" passive , \" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters . \\nhe also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn\\'t like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he\\'s getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end . \\nthe coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don\\'t just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either . \\ni think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained . \\naudience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first . \\n \" it\\'s good knowin\\' he\\'s out there , the dude , takin\\' it easy , \" posits the narrator towards the end . \\ni dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" gattaca \" represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science-fiction films -- it\\'s a genre picture that doesn\\'t rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story . \\nthe movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction . \\nthis allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color , intelligence and life span they\\'d like for their child , and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects . \\nthose made the old-fashioned way are labeled as \" in-valids \" and confined to the lower rung of society . \\nvincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) is one such person , born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish-molded younger brother anton . \\nfed up with being second-rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space , vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation . \\neveryday , he watches as \" superior \" folk make his fantasy a reality . \\ndetermined to do the same , vincent meets a dna broker ( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo ) who sells fake identities to in-valids . \\nhis counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow ( jude law ) , an ex-athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life . \\nfor a price and the promise of a caretaker , jerome supplies vincent with his identity , as well as blood , skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on-the-job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card . \\nbecause of his drastically improved status , vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca , and catches the eye of comely co-worker irene ( uma thurman ) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect , she\\'s enamored by his flawless persona she doesn\\'t know is a lie . \\nbut on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure , the mission director is murdered . \\ntwo ardent detectives ( alan arkin and billy bathgate\\'s loren dean ) determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca , and the sole clue they find at the crime scene -- one of vincent\\'s eyelashes -- threatens to blow vincent\\'s cover and derail his goal . \\neven if \" gattaca \" were dramatically empty , it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials -- the film\\'s look is dazzling without ever being flashy . \\nfirst-time director/writer andrew niccol ( he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama \" the truman show \" ) demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish ; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak , production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy , retro ambiance . \\nan opening credits sequence -- where skin , nail and hair fragments fall in slow-motion through a colored camera lens -- displays these combined talents uncannily . \\nniccol even utilizes voice-over narration ( a device almost always poorly-employed ) in an effective way . \\nwhen it comes to acting , the movie is also flawless . \\nethan hawke does magnificent work , proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level . \\nhis chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side , but needfully so , adding to the setting\\'s clinical chill . \\nas the bitter jerome , jude law has a star-making presence , and it\\'s his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core . \\nin \" gattaca \" \\'s series of final shots , the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other , and the effect is sad , lyrical and beautiful . \\nthings get a little strange as the movie nears its climax , when vincent\\'s relationship with his brother comes back into view . \\nthe big dramatic culmination is a swim race , which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed . \\nstill , the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop -- it\\'s successful sci-fi without showy special effects , it\\'s a crisp thriller with character-driven thrills , it\\'s a futuristic fable without blood and guts . \\neven its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot , ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage . \\nalthough it\\'s portrayal of the upcoming century is grim , \" gattaca \" serves up one of the most thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film . \\n',\n",

\\nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . \\nthere\\'s no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . \\nanother problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . \\ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . \\nand jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . \\nunlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you\\'ll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles . \" \\nfurthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . \\noddly , this isn\\'t just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . \\nwell , he\\'s done a good job . \\nthe hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . \\nthat\\'s not jake lloyd\\'s fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . \\nthat\\'s another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . \\nwarning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! \\nin my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin\\'s future evil in the film . \\nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there\\'s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . \\nhe has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . \\nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn\\'t all hearts and roses is yoda\\'s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . \\nhis explanation ? \\n \" his future is clouded . \" \\n ( warning : major spoiler ahead . \\nenter at your own risk . ) \\nof course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . \\nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . \\nbecause qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon\\'s young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . \\nso , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker . \\ndid this story need to be told ? \\ni would say no . \\nbut is it a worthwhile movie to see ? \\nabsolutely . \\nif you don\\'t enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . \\nthe tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . \\nthe digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . \\nand yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . \\nabove all , this is a fun movie . \\nnot deep , not meaningful , and not profound . \\nbut fun . \\nmaybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed \" empire \" will direct . \\nbecause if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . \\n : ) \\n',\n",

\\nnow for the bad news . \\nthe entire plot of \" mission to mars \" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe . \\nthe famed \\'face on mars\\' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed . \\nborrowing ideas from such films as \" robinson crusoe on mars \" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" , and even mario bava\\'s \" planet of the vampires \" ( \\'terrore nello spazio\\' ) ( 1965 ) , \" mission to mars \" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don\\'t add up to a satisfying whole . \\nwhile some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving . \\nso much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use . \\nthe performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry . \\ngary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation . \\nand the mistaken idea of having jerry o\\'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse . \\nand the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better . \\nhe\\'s just having too much fun here to give a damn . \\nthe script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage . \\nthis of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship . \\nalso , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation . \\nbut the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone . \\nsubtlety is non-existent here . \\nin fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out . \\nthe only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower . \\nthe pacing of the film is very leisurely . \\nafter the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface . \\nthen , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity . \\nthe film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum . \\nthere are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop . \\nthe good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at . \\nthe vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring . \\nthe design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that hasn\\'t been seen since \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" . \\nthe visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth . \\nthe only fault come with the martians themselves , which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world . \\ndirector de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film . \\nthe opening sequence alone in a seemingly un-interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage\\' to hitchcock\\'s \" rope \" ) , as we are introduced to all of the characters . \\nscenes in the rescue ship , with its rotating centrifuge , are just amazing in their execution . \\nbut the nagging question , is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang . \\nsadly it is not . \\ndirector brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production . \\nthe set design and visual effects are all arresting . \\nbut it\\'s the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous , thought provoking science fiction . \\na disappointing film , but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals . \\n',\n",

       " b'nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 ) \\na film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson \\nthis extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker\\'s \" dracula \" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore . \\ninspired by f . w . murnau\\'s 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog\\'s film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards . \\nthe original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u . s . distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints . \\nuntil now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe . \\nboth of these re-releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue . \\napparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed . \\nthe german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one . \\neveryone knows the story of dracula . \\nor do they ? \\nhis story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won\\'t hurt . \\njonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker\\'s hometown . \\nupon seeing a photo of harker\\'s wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her . \\nlocking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him . \\nupon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises . \\nthat is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker\\'s tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art . \\nnosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue-ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised . \\nthe film\\'s surreal , dream-like quality is utterly mesmerising . \\nthere is much to enjoy , but i\\'ll limit my praise to a few key points . \\nholding the film together is kinski\\'s remarkable performance as count dracula . \\npast screen portrayals , including bela lugosi\\'s famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp . \\nbut kinski . . . oh boy , this is something far more compelling . \\naided by a startling make-up job , he portrays dracula\\'s vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease . \\nthis man is dreadfully lonely . \\nhe lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust . \\nkinski\\'s portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting . \\nwhen he dies , you almost feel as if this man\\'s tortured soul has been freed at last . \\nthen there\\'s the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh . \\nit is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it\\'s quite impossible to imagine the film without it . \\npopul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient-sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments . \\nwhen i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums . \\nthe one i still listen to the most is \" tantric songs \" , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken . \\nit\\'s a testament to the music\\'s depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them . \\nthe album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies . \\nthis is a timely re-release by anchor bay . \\nafter francis ford coppola\\'s unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker\\'s tale in 1992 , it is a joy to go back to herzog\\'s film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century-old story . \\nto some aficionados , nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made . \\nwithout a doubt , it is an unmistakable classic of the genre . \\ndon\\'t miss it . \\n',\n",
       " b'the ads for \" batman and robin \" scream \" the event of the summer is here \" and that\\'s the problem . \\nthe producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . \\n \" batman and robin \" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance . \\nit\\'s like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun . \\nit wasn\\'t always this way . \\ntim burton\\'s \" batman \" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . \\nthe film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . \\nbatman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . \\nthe joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . \\nbatman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city\\'s breathtaking gothic skyline . \\nthose days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck . \\n \" batman and robin \" has far more in common with the campy 60\\'s batman tv show than with tim burton\\'s tale of darkness . \\nthe blame lies with director joel schumacher . \\na former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . \\nunfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn\\'t the faintest notion of what to do . \\n \" batman and robin \" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it\\'s often difficult to tell who\\'s whacking who . \\nwhile the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti . \\na few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film . \\n \" batman and robin \" doesn\\'t merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions . \\nit\\'s rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one . \\nironically , the parts of \" batman and robin \" that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . \\neasily the best batman yet , clooney\\'s expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn\\'t even hint at . \\nthe film\\'s most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne\\'s butler and surrogate father . \\nas for the other heroes , chris o\\'donnell\\'s robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . \\nin a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne\\'s girlfriend is puzzling . \\ni suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . \\nof course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that\\'s where \" batman and robin \" really suffers . \\nas mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion . \\nlaboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he\\'s having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act . \\numa thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . \\nshe overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it\\'s apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) . \\nonce thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . \\nthurman fails to maintain the character\\'s maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film . \\nthe biggest lesson to be learned from \" batman and robin \" is that more is not better . \\njoel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is . \\nsome critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . \\ni don\\'t think so . \\nmy prescription ? \\nfire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist\\'s convention so he\\'ll understand that there\\'s no hard feelings ) . \\ngive alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o\\'donnell and michael gough . \\ncall jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman . \\nthen , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the \" event \" mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time . \\n',\n",
       " b'based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider-man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half-vampire half-human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire\\'s latest meal . \\nnow swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all . \\nhis latest challenge is his biggest though . . . he \\nmust stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires . \\nadmitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some . \\njudging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film . \\nto some degree , i agree with this sentiment . \\nhaving read comic books since the age of nine ( i\\'m 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , #5 , blade . \\n ( \" men in black \" is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book ) \\nwhy is this ? \\nfor the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand \\nthe comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match . \\nthe crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided . \\nthe mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect . \\nsuperman \\nis not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this . \\nblade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere . \\nthis is in stark contrast to joel schumacher\\'s contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960\\'s television show . \\nbatman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i\\'m working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i\\'m ready ) . \\nwhich brings me back to blade . \\nalthough he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon . \\nthe film depicts a vicious vampire killer that \\nuses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends . \\nthe end results are not pretty by any means . \\nthe story elements work very well -- for a comic book story . \\nscreenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films . \\nthis is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n\\'bushe wright . \\nthis leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires . \\nadd this \\nto the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an \" anti-theft device \" ) , and one has an interesting premise . \\nhowever , the film works best as an action film . \\nactor wesley snipes has \\nan extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move . \\nproving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a \\ngood example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes . \\nregardless , this film is far from perfect . \\nthe film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god . \\nthe ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on \\nmarked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square ) . \\nobvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either ) . \\nmuch of the special effects are not that spectacular either . \\nwhile vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film\\'s release date was pushed back multiple times ) . \\nscenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i\\'m really hard to impress ) . \\nthe film\\'s r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of \\nrealism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence , \\nwatch \" saving private ryan \" ) . \\nthe overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin , both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi . \\nstill , scenes involving non-cgi special effects do surface ( and look much more impressive ) , such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade\\'s sword without deactivating the \" anti-theft device \" . \\nwesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess . \\nwhile not talking much , he is a grand physical presence , leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust . \\na decent ( by comic book film standards ) storyline also helps . \\n',\n",

       " b\"i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer . \\neven though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen . \\nbut i don't care . \\nnot even a little . \\nmy reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great . \\n2 ) drew barrymore is great . \\n3 ) the movie is so funny . \\nthere are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard . \\ni haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers . \\nsandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music . \\nin the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness . \\na week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) . \\nwith his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress . \\nshe is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months . \\njulia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans . \\nsoon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other . \\noh sure , it's trite . \\nand if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience . \\nwhat makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances . \\nbarrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) . \\nnot only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written . \\nand the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen . \\nnaturally , the true star here is sandler . \\ni think the guy is flat-out hilarious . \\nhe can say something that just isn't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh . \\nhis comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy . \\nwhereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into . \\nas far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents . \\nand the movie is just so funny . \\nperhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him . \\nthis is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air . \\nand while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half . \\nmy formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important . \\nthe film is predicable , but who cares ? \\nthe characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable . \\nin addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film . \\nin that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review . \\ni just want everyone to know that i laughed . \\na lot . \\n\",\n",

       " b'this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron\\'s most heralded film , titanic . \\npostponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview . \\nso , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ? \\nmy best guess . . . . it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull . \\nno doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made . \\nit boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date . \\nto see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at . \\nthe effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage . \\nbut titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that\\'s where the problem lies . \\nthere is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise . \\ni\\'ll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you : \\nthe film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic . \\nwe see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor . \\nbill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure . \\nwhat he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage . \\nwe meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family . \\nrose is to be wed to a man she does not love . \\nwe meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game . \\nthe two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins . \\nadd in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy . \\ni must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with \" new money \" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship . \\nshe is a pleasure to see on screen . \\nwhen the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters . \\nthe film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on . \\nthe effects are tremendous . \\nfrom the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other . \\nwe saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen . \\nmy friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard . \\nwhen people are in the water , at film\\'s end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles . \\ntitanic runs far too long . \\nthe movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length . \\nand , while most of the first 2 . 5 hours runs very fast and well-paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong about titanic . . . . it\\'s \\nnot a bad as i am making it out to be . \\nit really is an exceptionaly well-made film . \\nthe costumes and sets are incredible , and true to the time period . \\nthe ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form , as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction . \\nthis film will certainly win on effects , costume , set design and sound . \\ncameron has certainly made his best film to date . \\nunfortunately , titanic is not a best picture candidate . \\nit just doesn\\'t have a strong supporting story . \\nit\\'s an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside . \\nit just doesn\\'t have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . cameron was shooting for . \\ni predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews . \\nit is a film worth seeing . \\ni predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office . \\nwith its extreme running time , and lack of enough robust to get substantial word-of-mouth , i expect that it will do even better on home video . \\nthis will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts . \\ntitanic opens december 19th , and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century-fox . \\ni give titanic 3 stars ( . \\nthat\\'s not bad . \\nron epstein \\nriginally posted in home theater forum === \\n',\n",

       " b\"review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders . \\nliving with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house' if they don't pay the rent ) . \\nnello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life . \\n ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century . ) \\nnot that these are the only things that make nello's life happy , however . \\nhe has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master . \\nin addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class' nello . \\n ( he thinks he's not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying . ) \\nbut then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film ) . \\none day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist . \\nand every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money . \\neager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him . \\none night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them . \\nshe gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand . \\n ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers . \\nunfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale . \\naloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again . \\nbad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles . \\naloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise . \\nthis decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by . \\nmatters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral . \\nbut then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly . \\nthis means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind . \\nworst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess' , fails to win the prize at the festival . \\nnow nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death . \\nwill nello be able to find any happiness in his life ? \\nwill patrasche save the day ? \\nwill nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ? \\na dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages . \\neven older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too . \\nthere have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself . \\nmove over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight . \\nthe cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film . \\nit also gives a feel of being in flanders ( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders ) . \\nthe music from richard friedman is also remarkable ; an evocative , poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century . \\nthe opening song over the credits is very beautiful ( i hope the soundtrack is available ! ) , and there's a brief excerpt of `cheer up , charlie' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory ( sung by aloise , to nello , in another delightful scene ) . \\nthe cast is first-rate : jesse james and jeremy james kissner , who play nello , are some of the most endearing , adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life ( so are the girls who play aloise , madyline sweeten as the younger , and farren monet as the older ) . \\nnot that they are the only good stars , however . \\njack warden is ideal as jehan , eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character . \\n ( the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming , touching ones . ) \\nalso , bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william . \\nhe's another one of my favorite characters in the film . \\nbut jon voight , as i mentioned before , is the perfect choice for michel . \\nhe brings a mysterious , yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he * can * win the contest . \\nbut what makes this film fun to watch is how well-defined the characters are , and the pace of the story ( best of all , it has a happy ending ? though i will * not * give it away ; sorry ) is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters . \\nfor the first time since the beginning of 1999 , there comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff , such as big-budget special effects , commercial rock soundtracks , or any of that stuff . \\nthis one relies on telling a fully character-oriented story , with just the right amount of heart , humor , and drama . \\nthat , to me , is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful . \\neleanor o'sullivan of `the home news & tribune' noticed this , and was kind and generous enough to welcome it : `for want of a better word , a glow surrounds a dog of flanders . \\nits heart is in the right place and it engages you . \\nyou can guess where the film is going because this is well-traveled territory , but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner , an often-told story is well worth a revisit . ' \\nin addition , there were a couple of other enthusiasts , such as chicago-sun times and the washington post ( you should read their reviews ; they're really positive ) . \\nother critics , however , were not so kind . \\nstephen holden of `the new york times' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing . \\nhe found the film to be a `sea of sugary bromides' and condemned mr . voight's character as `hopelessly wooden ? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda . ' \\nin addition , `entertainment weekly' slam-dunked the film , condemning it as `the worst family film of the year . ' \\nthere have been so many other bad reviews like this , too . \\nmy suggestion : disregard the critics . \\nthey just have a big problem with touching family films , and one should never pay attention to them . \\nthis dog of flanders may only be a little `family' movie ( it probably won't be a big hit in the style of titanic , but then again no other film has been since then ) , but that is not a bad thing in and of itself . \\nthis is a story that is sure to warm your heart , and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders . \\nit is also one of the better family films around this year . \\nnone of the other films i have seen this year ( though they were good ) have been so low-key and touching . \\nif you're looking for family-style entertainment , look no further than this charming boy-and-dog yarn . \\ngo see it while you still can , for as i mentioned , it might not be a big bow-wow at the box office for a long time . \\nsee it while you can . \\nthere is really no need to compare a multi-million dollar blockbuster such as star wars : episode i ? the phantom menace or tarzan , or even the iron giant with a tender , sweet little family movie . \\n\",\n",

       " b'on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento\\'s much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . \\nin emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his \" giallo \" murder mysteries . \\nwhile it\\'s certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . \\nthe story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book \" tenebrae \" . \\nwith the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . \\nthe film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . \\nhe brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . \\nthe film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . \\nargento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . \\ntenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento\\'s scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . \\nit may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . \\nin that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . \\nneedless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director\\'s brilliance as a stylist . \\nmany of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . \\nthey are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . \\ninstead , tenebrae\\'s set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . \\nand the soundtrack\\'s mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . \\nso tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . \\nstill , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . \\nsome critics argue that logic doesn\\'t matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don\\'t deserve to feel cheated . \\nby the way , if you don\\'t want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . \\nabout an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . \\nwe witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . \\nhe is insane , apparently . \\nthe murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it\\'s time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . \\nhe is finally revealed to us as this \" second killer \" in the film\\'s bloody climax . \\nbut argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . \\nyou see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer\\'s house . \\nbut thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . \\nbad cutting puts the timing way out . \\nin other words , he\\'s almost in two places at once . \\nduring this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . \\nby the film\\'s end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . \\nthe injury ? \\nhe banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! \\nthus , the revelation of the \" hero \" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . \\nhelpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . \\nbut there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . \\nthe story owes us a better understanding of franciosa\\'s mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . \\ntenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . \\nfor instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . \\nwe would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren\\'t even introduced too ! \\nthat\\'s careless filmmaking , pure and simple . \\nwhy , you may ask , do i go on about the story\\'s flaws ? \\nbecause when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . \\ntake one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . \\nan upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . \\nfinally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer\\'s lair . \\nit\\'s an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . \\nand that\\'s exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . \\ntoo often , it seems , argento\\'s films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . \\nmind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . \\nand if you\\'re a fan of argento\\'s unique style of giallo thriller then it\\'s essential . \\nsee the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . \\nit\\'s a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . \\na shame , because it doesn\\'t have to be that way . \\ntake argento\\'s more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . \\nproof that he can do it , if he tries . . . \\n',\n",

       " b'robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein . \\nmel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit . \\nunfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world . \\nit is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce . \\nthe plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves . \\nthis is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie . \\nmel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on . \\nthe movie\\'s scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice . \\ncary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard . \\nhe escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis . \\nhe also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil \" sheriff of rottingham \" . \\na good adventure plot that is sadly unused . \\nelwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating . \\nneither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren\\'t funny , nor believable . \\nperhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone . \\nthis particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre . \\nmuch of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre . \\nchuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from \" rent-a-wreck \" ) then from any dialogue whatsoever . \\nscenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting . \\nperhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive . \\nthe basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny . \\nmel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) . \\nthe movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails . \\nthe addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive . \\nthe only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard . \\nhe is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting . \\nif you can\\'t , don\\'t even bother watching this miserable film . \\n',\n",
       " b'mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . ) \\nwith three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest \" hot properties \" in action adventure stardom , and it\\'s just about time . \\nfor over twenty-five years , jackie\\'s been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . \\n \" drunken master \" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to \" make it big \" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . \\ni\\'m not entirely sure why , exactly . \\nin many ways , \" drunken master \" is similar to most of jackie\\'s other early films , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii , \" master with cracked fingers \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , \" spiritual kung fu \" , and others . \\nin fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . \\nto be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . \\nthey\\'re quite different from action movies as we know them in america . \\nthese films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . \\n \" drunken master \" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . \\n ( as an aside , \" drunken master \" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in \\na movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . \\nat the time , i didn\\'t really think it was anything special . . . but \\nafter having seen more films like it , it\\'s kind of grown on me . ) \\n \" drunken master \" \\'s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii and \" master with cracked fingers \" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been \" adapted , \" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . \\nmore specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka \" naughty panther , \" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . \\nafter embarrassing his instructor\\'s assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and \\nis further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . \\nhis father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . \\nkei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . \\nwhile escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . \\nthis turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . \\nhe assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . \\nthen , when he\\'s ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . \\nunfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . \\n \" drunken master \" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . \\nit\\'s been said before , but i\\'ll say it again--these fights don\\'t just _happen_ , they\\'re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . \\nin his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . \\nthe fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . \\nwhether jackie wins or loses , it\\'s really something to see . . . and \\nit\\'s often as funny as anything , too . \\nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . \\nthere\\'s very little that\\'s new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these \\nschticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . \\nbut they\\'re still hilarious as ever . \\nlikewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they\\'re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . \\nthe really big thing about \" drunken master \" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . \\ni\\'m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and \\nit apparently helps if you\\'re drunk while you\\'re doing it . \\ngenuine or not , i have to admit , there\\'s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what\\'s going on . \\ncome to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film\\'s success over any of the other jackie films . . . it\\'s \\nnot just martial arts , it\\'s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , \" whoa . . . \" \\non the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . \\n \" gone with the wind \" , this isn\\'t . \\nstill , if you like martial arts films , or like what you\\'ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . \\nit\\'s much more \" real \" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . \\nyou might very well like it . \\nanother interesting thing about \" drunken master \" has to do with its video availability in the us . \\n \" drunken master \" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . \\nthere are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . \\nthankfully , \" drunken master \" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . \\nif you like \" drunken master \" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren\\'t really _too_ bad . . . if \\nnothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . \\ni particularly recommend \" spiritual kung fu \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , the \" fearless hyena \" movies , and \" snake & crane arts of shaolin \" . \\nalso , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , \" drunken master ii \" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . \\nalso , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i\\'ve been told to suggest the \" once upon a time in china \" series starring jet li ( though i haven\\'t personally seen any of them yet ) . \\nif you choose to watch \" drunken master \" , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that\\'s out there . \\nall in all , i give this film an . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" the endurance : shackleton\\'s legendary antarctic expedition \" \\nin 1914 , as the great war descended upon europe , sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica , this time to be the first to cross the ice-bound continent on foot . \\n28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years . \\ndirector george butler , using film footage and photographs from the historic journey , tells their remarkable story in \" the endurance : shackleton\\'s legendary antarctic expedition . \" \\nthe expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse , on foot , the vast wasteland of antarctica . \\nas the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea , the entry to the cold , cruel continent , they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land . \\nfor months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed , stranding the men on the flow , propelling them away from their goal and , eventually , into their lifeboats for safety . \\nshackleton , faced with a desolate situation , made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island . \\nonce on this \" safe \" haven , shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization . \\nhe and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the world\\'s roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia . \\nmiraculously , the six land , after 17 days at sea , on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous , snow covered mountains , covering 22 miles in just 36 hours . \\nthis ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen . \\nin the end , he is successful and everyone made it back home alive , only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war . \\nthe title of this fascinating documentary , \" the endurance , \" is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world . \\nit is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived 19-months of the toughest , most grueling conditions on the face of the earth . \\nthe name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather . \\nit also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men . \\nwith astonishing foresight , shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey . \\nthe filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men , day to day life , the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs , the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow . \\nafter the sinking of the ship , the remaining film stock , with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film , had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on . \\nconsidering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world\\'s harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself . \\n ( hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary , \" south , \" an interesting companion piece for \" the endurance . \" \\nif shackleton\\'s original idea , document his trek across the frigid southern continent , had been successful , it would have been considered a super human feat . \\nas you watch the story of \" the endurance \" unfold , you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent . \\n ( shackleton\\'s amazing 800-mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself . ) \\nthere are a couple of minor nitpicks with this fine work , though . \\nactor liam neeson narrates the story , but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale . \\nthe nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material , both film and photo , in the documentary\\'s first half . \\nas the crew\\'s adventure takes more drastic paths , hurley had less and less film stock available to chronicle the awesome events . \\nhelmer butler and his team fill in the blanks , but the treasure of \" the endurance , \" its film footage , is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition . \\ni can\\'t think of a true-life adventure that shows , better , the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds . \\n \" the endurance , \" based on caroline alexander\\'s book , is an eye-opening documentary that goes where few men have gone before and , even more remarkably , all 28 survivors lived to tell about it . \\ni give it a b+ . \\n',\n",

       " b'steven spielberg\\'s \" amistad , \" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who \" owned \" them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story . \\nfirst , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery . \\nsecond , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . \\nlast , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade . \\n \" amistad \" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements . \\ni have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another \" anti-slavery \" movie . \\nhaving seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn\\'t already know about it . \\nfortunately , i turned out to be wrong . \\nfor one thing , spielberg\\'s camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders\\' operations in africa , so \" amistad \" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning . \\nand some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery . \\none scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their \" excess \" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year . \\nspielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating . \\nthe stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time . \\nexposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation . \\nthe film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court . \\nthe biggest success of \" amistad \" is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court . \\nthrough cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ . \\ncinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles . \\n \" what kind of country is this , where laws \\'almost\\' work ? \" he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court . \\nspielberg\\'s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque\\'s angry outburst in the court room . \\nstill , there isn\\'t enough of this for it to be a serious problem . \\nthe main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can\\'t quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie . \\nthis summer\\'s contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once . \\n \" amistad \" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through . \\nperhaps the best way to describe it is this : \" amistad \" is three four star films edited into one . \\nalmost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts . \\nhowever , i can\\'t honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery . \\n',\n",
       " b'the ultimate match up between good and evil , \" the untouchables \" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . \\nbased on the 1959 television show of the same title , \" the untouchables \" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . \\nthe film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . \\nelliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . \\nhowever , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . \\nthe fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . \\nthe film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . \\nthe film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone\\'s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . \\nfrom this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . \\nright from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . \\nthis developed hatred is before the film\\'s hero , ness , is even introduced . \\ni found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . \\nthe film only gets better from this point . \\nwith the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . \\nthey walk in unison and they only look forward . \\nas they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . \\nholding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . \\none that comes to mind is \" the matrix \" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . \\nwearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930\\'s style , the similarities between these two are countless . \\n \" the untouchables \" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . \\nthe four members were the only ones willing to go against capone\\'s army . \\neach member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others . \\nelliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film . \\nhe begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be . \\nhowever , as the film develops so does ness . \\nhis beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side . \\nhe also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . \\nhis anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in . \\nsean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables . \\nmalone acts as a mentor to ness . \\nhe teaches him \" the chicago way \" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . \\nconnery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . \\nandy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . \\nas ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . \\ncharles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . \\nsmith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film . \\nthe action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . \\nalso very similar to \" the matrix , \" they are exciting and intense . \\n>from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . \\nthe score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement . \\nits pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . \\nthe combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective . \\nalthough the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action . \\nsome scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid . \\n',\n",
       " b'working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front-line african american actress like jada pinkett smith . \\ndespite being one of the freshest talents available , pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame , the nutty professor ) . \\nthe problem is , of course , that there aren\\'t many good roles available for black women . \\ntake away the likes of waiting to exhale , set it off , soul food , and eve\\'s bayou , and all that\\'s left is a chance to be someone\\'s girlfriend , a local whore , or a murder victim . \\nas a result , for pinkett smith\\'s first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo . \\nactually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v . s . \\nmayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is . \\nthe film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on-screen relationship between pinkett smith\\'s woo and tommy davidson\\'s tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren\\'t forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags . \\nunfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit i . q . \\nthe situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of \" free lobotomy \" lab experiment . \\nwoo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places . \\nher latest relationship , with a testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper . \\nnow , her transvestite/medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she\\'s about to meet mr . right , and that he\\'ll be a virgo . \\nlater that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo . \\nit\\'s not love at first sight , however . \\nthings get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a \" quiet \" dinner . \\nin the one-hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad \" white \" movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it\\'s only fair that we get a \" black \" effort of the same low caliber . \\nas in all romantic comedies , we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together . \\nthe question is , are their courtship rituals entertaining ? \\nin a good entry to the genre , the audience becomes caught up in the love story , no matter how familiar it is . \\nin woo , the constant reliance upon unfunny , moronic humor sinks the project . \\nfor those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes , there\\'s a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) . \\nsadly , that\\'s one of the film\\'s most enjoyable sequences , and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional . \\ndespite exuding charm from every pore , there\\'s little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c . johnson\\'s script . \\nsince it misses the mark by so much , a better name for woo might have been whoops . \\n',\n",

       " b\"movies based on video games , such as street fighter or mario bros . , have never generated much interest at the box office . \\nbut when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well . \\nwith a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy . \\nit got my vote for 'the movie where i expected the least and got the most' . \\nand , if you haven't had the opportunity , i would definitely recommend that you see it on video . \\nin the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity . \\nthe mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld's minions , which if won , will guarantee earth's safety for another generation . \\nmk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition . \\ndespite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth . \\noutworld's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four-armed ogre ) , and sindel . \\nearth's mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld's forces . \\nit's an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie . \\nit is only a video game , after all , but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it's comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self-worth , and worst of all , a love story . \\nthis becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing more . \\nthey are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act . \\nthis becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana . \\nthe original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best . \\nthey spoke little , but fought a lot . \\nthus , the movie was easy to digest . \\nhowever , mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth , an element that was lacking in the first movie , but the attempt here fails miserably . \\nthis uneasy feeling is readily apparent , for example , whenever you hear lord rayden speak . \\nnot only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic ( e . g . \\nuseless ) advice , but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom . \\ntry reading this half as fast , and you'll hear what i mean . \\nbut the movie is not a complete fatality . \\nfight scenes are well-choreographed , highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility . \\nand players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game , although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo . \\neven if you're not familiar with the video game , each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves . \\nbut it's just too little of what movie-goers and especially fans of the game will expect . \\noddly , the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence . \\nand the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival . \\n ( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom ) . \\nrent the first one , but the sequel is for kombat fans only . \\n\",\n",

       " b'starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see . \\ntherefore , it\\'s with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas . \\ndespite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters . \\na group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the \" savages \" that live there . \\nthe natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust . \\nonly the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash . \\nthe ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film\\'s finer moments . \\nthe characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth . \\ngovernor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses . \\ncaptain john smith is a blond hunk who , while \" slightly \" misguided , is good at heart . \\npocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time . \\nshe even comes complete with insignificant best friend . \\nagain , against tradition , talking animals aren\\'t used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is . \\nthis is an odd compromise , but it\\'s one of the few elements that really work . \\nthe animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation . \\nmaybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes . \\nthe talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch . \\nthe music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , \" colors of the wind . \" \\nmel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more . \\nthe opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character . \\ni was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time . \\neven the children in the audience seemed restless . \\nwhile there\\'s no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed . \\nperhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history . \\nit\\'s all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie\\'s entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn\\'t work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer\\'s minds and plot holes that are never filled . \\neven the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious . \\nas mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film . \\nfor instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with \" savages , \" why did he so quickly change his previous \" kill as many indians as i can \" attitude . \\nif he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this . \\nor how about pocahontas\\' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? \\ni can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway . \\nas it is , i wonder if it doesn\\'t give kids the wrong impression . \\nin short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set . \\nwhile disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels . \\n',\n",

       " b'the king and i , a warner brothers animated , musical feature , recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king , with obvious results . \\nwhen anna ( miranda richardson ) , a british schoolteacher , travels to saim to educate the king\\'s ( martin vidnovic ) children , she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly , and must say something to the greedy ruler . \\nmeanwhile , the king\\'s prime minister ( ian richardson ) , the stereotypical villain , plots to overthrow the king , taking the throne . \\nthe last , and most predictable , main subplot deals with the king\\'s son ( allen d . hong ) , and his love for a servant , tuptim ( armi arabe ) , and how he conflicts with his feelings , and the ancient laws of saim . \\nnot even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent , as the king and i\\'s problems could fill the blank pages of a journal . \\ni will only note the major difficulties , for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail . \\nthe screenplay , written by arthur rankin , peter bakalian , jacqeline feather , and david seidler , which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein , has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory , as every time the obnoxious king would shout , \" etc , etc , etc , \" i would cringe . \\nliterally . \\nspeaking of cringing- i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film , which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking . \\nbesides the repetitive dialogue from the king , on the whole , the songs seem out of place , and unlike the lyrics , are unmagical . \\nthe sole song which is used cleverly is \" getting to know you , \" which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors , which they have never been exposed to . \\nunlike disney animated features , the king and i\\'s songs don\\'t add to the film , and are as uneffective as could be . \\ntake the following scenario as an example , as the sheer horror of the king and i\\'s music is at its worst . \\nyou\\'re being hunted by a dragon ! \\nwhat do you do ! ? \\nsing a happy song ! \\nmartin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion- you hear the saying two negatives don\\'t make a positive ? \\nbelieve it ! \\nwith the terrible dialogue that the king has , along with his awful voice track , the king is completely unbelievable , only shows mild signs of any personality , and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says \" etc . , etc . , etc . , \" more and more as the film progresses . \\nno personality at the beginning of the movie , none at the end . \\nand where does this character\\'s personality change ? \\nhey , i thought anna was supposed to change him ! \\nisn\\'t that the whole plot ? \\nthe prime minister\\'s hideous sidekick ( darrell hammond ) brings his share of cringes as well - oh no ! \\nanother one of his teeth fell out ! \\nhardy-har-har ! \\nhe is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets , but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him . \\nby the way this review is going , you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films- hence why i hate this movie , because the king and i is a disgrace to animation . \\nanimated films , such as 1994\\'s the lion king and 1998\\'s the prince of egypt , are among my favorite movies of all time . \\nthe animation team does design their share of well animated settings , so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king , until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds . \\ni have not read the play , or seen the oscar winning , 1956 film adaption , but from what i can tell , the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play , for the king and i is never magical , nor interesting . \\nif it wasn\\'t for miranda richardson , who voices anna with feeling , the king and i could earn the title , \" worst movie of the decade . \" \\ninstead , the king and i will just go down as among the year\\'s worst . \\nthe bottom line- avoid this movie at all costs . \\nnot even young children , the target audience in this film , will enjoy it . \\nnot the slightest bit . \\n',\n",

' \\nthe year is 3000 . \\nmankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group ) . \\na small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons' who dwell in the cities below . \\nthe psychlos are strip-mining the earth for its resources and terel , played by travolta , is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in denver . \\na young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler , played with dramatic flair by barry pepper , ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons . ' \\nhe is promptly captured and taken to the alien base . \\nafter several attempts at escape , johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel's , involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end . \\njonnie , assumed leader of the mining slave group , then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use . \\nthen the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry , the bill of rights , how to use a machine gun , and how to fly a harrier jet . \\nthe whole mess concludes with a big , loud , obnoxious gun-and-plane battle that had me praying for the end credits . \\nroger christian , the director of this lumbering beast , must have rented dune , blade runner , planet of the apes , independence day , stargate , beastmaster , the airwolf episodes , the `v' miniseries , the matrix , and the omega man . . . \\nand decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth . \\nchristian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie ! \\nand every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe -- really . \\nthe psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit . \\ntravolta's acting hasn't been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect . \\njonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight !

       " b'it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system . \\nno major surprise , when j . s . mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either . \\nthe americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist , the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority . \\nsmall wonder that hollywood\\'s most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual-underdog against some larger collective oppressive - witness braveheart , born on the fourth of july , rocky , first blood , clear and present danger , jfk , the list goes on . \\nthere\\'s little of that in singapore - we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line , though the government\\'s been long worried about the younger people getting \" americanised \" and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition . \\nthe people vs . larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america - sex . \\ndoes pornography have a right to exist and circulate ? \\nlarry flynt , the publisher of hustler magazine , thinks so , and obviously so too the u . s . congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net . \\nbut even with such actions , americans remain undecided . \\nthe oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire . \\nwhat they have ignored is actually a great picture . \\nwoody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to-hell-with-morality , to-hell-with-the-law , and to-hell-with-the-system anti-christ that we last saw in natural born killers . \\nand he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex-stripper wife dearly . \\nthe latter is played with abandon , conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love , who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination , if not of the award itself . \\nedward norton plays their jerky lawyer . \\nthe relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox - superficially they are immoral outcasts who\\'ve had it coming ; woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down , and courtney dies of aids . \\ngod\\'s damnation . \\nbut in the powerful love they have for each other , each standing by the other in turn , the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and ( in the american context ) a christian , if they can love and care , and feel just like anyone else on a personal level . \\nfriedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral-christian influences . \\nto go beyond good and evil . \\nthis is a great picture , no doubt , and i love it personally . \\nbecause it is moving , funny , ends with open american optimism blah blah . \\nbut i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions , and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases . \\nthere are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities . \\nthis movie is not so much about larry flynt , but about americans and american society . \\n',\n",
       " b'when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects . \\nwhile i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don\\'t think that they are completely to blame for this movie\\'s failure . \\nit appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the \" unseen \" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny . \\nso special effects or not , if the story isn\\'t the least bit scary , you aren\\'t going to end up with a very frightening movie . \\nthe thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern . \\ndern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie . \\nas i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern\\'s caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast . \\nnever a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie . \\nliam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear . \\nhe decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion . \\nhe tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia . \\nand he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on . \\ncatherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects . \\nlike the original , taylor\\'s character is the star of the movie . \\nbut since she doesn\\'t quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original . \\nand let\\'s face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones . \\ni\\'ll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren\\'t in it . \\nbut the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets . \\nthey take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients . \\nthere really isn\\'t much of a story here . \\njust endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with . \\nand the special effects are great . \\nin many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere . \\nin other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the \" cool shots \" quota . \\nat no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe . \\nbut not scary . \\nthen we have the set . \\nwhen i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it . \\nbut it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route . \\nthis included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves . \\nwhat part did these rooms play in the story ? \\nabsolutely none . \\nthey were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie . \\nthen we have the actors . \\nlili taylor has never been one of my favorites . \\nand when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark . \\ni have no idea why liam neeson took this role . \\nhe basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus . \\nhis character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him . \\ni have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman . \\nzeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words . \\nthe fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake . \\nall catherine has to do in this movie is look good . \\nfortunately that is something she does very well . \\nwhile she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy . \\nit\\'s too bad someone of her talents wasted them here . \\nany random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role . \\nthe haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999\\'s horror movies , the blair witch project . \\nthe haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares . \\nboth prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film . \\nif the story sucks , it\\'s all downhill from there . \\nmy advice ?

       " b'synopsis : a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend , who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night . \\nwhile this is going on , the thug , the father , the boyfriend , and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter . \\ncomments : to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement . \\ni\\'m not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter . \\nsuspense ? \\nfamily drama ? \\nhumor ? \\nerotica ? \\nelements of each of these genres exist in the film , yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them . \\ninstead , the babysitter is a dull , lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers . \\ni suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren\\'t for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing . \\nalicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer , the babysitter . \\nher character has absolutely no depth at all , and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters\\' fantasies . \\neveryone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends . \\nthe parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds . \\nthe father ( played by j . t . \\nwalsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband\\'s best friend . \\nnone of these fantasy sequences , trust me , are things that need to be seen , but we see them anyway , complete with cheesy , make-out saxophone music . \\nthe thug , in the meantime , proves that he\\'s evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason . \\nthe most absurd character , however , is the babysitter\\'s boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead . \\nthe thug , in a manipulative , iago-like manner ( though he doesn\\'t really need to try hard ) , manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking , smoking grass , running away from cops , and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes . \\nincredible ! \\n ( of course , the boyfriend\\'s original plan for the evening was , try not to laugh , to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j . d . salinger . ) \\nif the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful , then it fails . \\nthere are surprisingly few tense moments in this film , and nearly all of them come at the final minute . \\nby that time , however , the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them . \\nno suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception . \\nif the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous , then it also fails . \\ni found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed , at times , to be played for laughs . \\nif the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic , then , once again , it fails . \\nthe characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting . \\nfinally , if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating ( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning ) , then it fails as well . \\nthe dream sequences aren\\'t erotic ; they are too brief and , outside of one very short scene , contain no nudity . \\ni can\\'t completely trash this movie . \\nthe first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film , and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight . \\nthe other 79 minutes , though , are a drag . \\nsilverstone\\'s character , at the end of the movie , turns to her boyfriend and asks \" what were you thinking ? \" \\ni asked myself the same question , having spent 99 cents renting this turkey . \\n',\n",
       " b'as with any gen-x mtv movie ( like last year\\'s dead man on campus ) , the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points : sex and football . \\nthose two items , wrapped in a guilty-pleasure package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales will decline for two reasons . \\nfirst , the football sequences are nothing new , nor can they be ; the sports genre isn\\'t mainstream and it\\'s been retread to death . \\nsecond , the sex is just bad . \\ndespite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all-night strip-club party , there\\'s nothing even remotely tantalizing . \\nthe acting is mostly mediocre , not including the fantastic jon voight . \\ncultivating his usual sliminess , voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer . \\nkilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes\\' twenty-two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years ; this year he plans to make it twenty-three . \\nunfortunately , when his star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , goes down for the count , he\\'s got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon ( james van der beek ) . \\nmoxon leads the team through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom , the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie ( amy smart ) , and other temptations that abound in football-crazy west canaan . \\nmost regions of the country are not nearly as football-crazy as texas , and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most . \\nsimilarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer . \\nthese elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv\\'s core audience is the high school demographic . \\nthis focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv\\'s \" dawson\\'s creek , \" is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role . \\nother stars are similarly young and unmemorable . \\nthere\\'s not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there\\'s not much to like about it , either . \\neverything herein has already been done , and if it hasn\\'t , the movie manages to botch it one way or another . \\nthis is certainly missable . \\n',\n",
       " b\"one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting . \\nthe main story is about dr . james nookey ( jim dale ) who is disliked by his superiors , frederick carver , head of the hospital ( kenneth williams ) , and dr . ernest stoppidge ( charles hawtrey ) who seems to dislike everyone . \\nthey attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey . \\ncarver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore ( joan sims ) on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there . \\nwhen nookey arrives at this island , he meets gladstone screwer ( sid james ) who has lived on the island just about all his life . \\nscrewer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients . \\ndr . nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore's financial backing . \\nhowever , nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug , and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug . \\nthe performances are all very commendable . \\nsid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role . \\nkenneth williams , as usual , plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital . \\njoan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey . \\ncharles hawtrey plays an 'out-of-character' role as dr . stoppidge , the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch . \\nsome critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well , but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters . \\nas a matter of fact , hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part . \\nother regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again ( but this part is probably her most boring 'matron' ) and barbara windsor as nookey's love interest and unofficial 'women's lib' campaigner , goldie locks . \\nboth jacques and windsor play their parts well . \\npatsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick , and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell ( from 'steptoe and son' fame ) and peter butterworth . \\nthe jokes are mostly very funny , the story is quite appealing , and the regulars seem interested in what they're doing . \\nalthough it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies , it still comes out on top ( it is the best medical carry on ) because of the above factors . \\na must-see carry on movie . \\n\",\n",

       " b'while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling\\'s true genius as a film-maker is casting . \\nin fast times at ridgemont high , she gave us sean penn\\'s jeff spicoli ; in look who\\'s talking , she turned bruce willis into a wise-cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival ; in clueless , she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was ) alicia silverstone . \\nshe seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws . \\nunfortunately , she may also be starting to understand that she understands . \\ngiving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies . \\ngiving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser . \\nnaturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy . \\npaul tannek ( jason biggs ) is a small-town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu , then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold-hearted big city . \\npaul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman ; his roommates adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul . \\npaul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar , in this case the lovely dora diamond ( mena suvari ) . \\ndora has problems of her own , including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor , edward alcott ( greg kinnear ) , that\\'s more than slightly one-sided . \\nthey\\'re two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people , so clearly they belong together , even if paul is a loser . \\ni must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling\\'s casting . \\njason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence . \\nthey\\'re pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren\\'t . \\nthen it gradually becomes clear that there\\'s virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort . \\nin theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk ) . \\ninstead of taking any time to make the characters\\' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters\\' situations pathetic . \\nshe shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film\\'s interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless\\'s plot came via jane austen\\'s emma ) . \\nshe simply turns the film into a pity party . \\nsince loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated . \\ninstead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there\\'s no reason to watch them . \\npaul isn\\'t just a nice guy , he\\'s flawless ; consequently , he\\'s a central character who does absolutely no growing . \\nhis roommates aren\\'t just inconsiderate , they\\'re actively evil-blackmailing professor alcott , drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name . \\nand professor alcott isn\\'t just manipulative , he turns dora into his house slave . \\ndora\\'s unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn\\'t explored in sufficient detail . \\nthere\\'s more ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from alan cumming\\'s broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it\\'s one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it\\'s another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush . \\nand it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow . . . \\ni don\\'t know . . . \\ncomic . \\nstill , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora . \\nthat hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel\\'s \" scarborough fair/canticle . \" \\ninstead of giving the sequence a knowing wink-a reference to the graduate , a hint that paul is becoming an overly-sensitive clich-heckerling plays it deadly straight . \\neven in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonist\\'s foibles , she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint . \\nclueless\\'s cher had her self-absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness . \\nin loser , amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness ( her one show of wit involves naming paul\\'s dorm \" hunt\\'s hall \" after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall ) . \\nher gift with casting proved to be her curse . \\nloser may be a crashing bore , but gee , aren\\'t those two kids swell ? \\n',\n",
       " b'andrew lloyd webber\\'s musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time . \\nwebber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as \" oklahoma ! , \" or the slapstickness of shows like \" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . \" \\nthey instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics . \\nlike \" jesus christ superstar , \" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune \" superstar , \" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn\\'t spread his message wider ) , \" evita \" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) . \\n \" evita \" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn\\'t like di slept to \" the top \" ) . \\nwebber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it . \\nhere , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad . \\nit\\'s also a musical , with almost no words not unsung . \\nthe film plays like a rock opera , much like their \" jesus christ superstar , \" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one . \\nafter all , this is a musical , and webber\\'s musicals never undermine this . \\nthey are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side . \\nthis is why the beginning of \" evita \" is kind of a let-down . \\nokay , it is a let-down . \\ni\\'m not saying the opening moments are bad , because they\\'re pretty good . \\nbut what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand . \\nin the musical , it\\'s a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , \" buenos aires , \" which is also lifeless . \\nthen a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , \" another suitcase in another hall , \" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva . \\nthe portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it\\'s being narrated by a hater of eva\\'s , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light . \\nfor a while , it looks like alan parker can\\'t pull it off . \\nhowever , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song \" goodbye and thank you , \" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful . \\nfrom this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical . \\nno more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact . \\nwe see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) . \\nmore importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work . \\njuan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory . \\na muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before . \\n>from the \" goodbye and thank you \" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation\\'s people downtrodden . \\nbut despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star . \\nthat\\'s when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn\\'t the great woman she really was , and expose her fame . \\ndescribing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he\\'s said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can\\'t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death . \\nalan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he\\'s done \" fame , \" \" the committments , \" \" bugsy malone , \" and \" pink floyd the wall \" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is . \\nwe cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented . \\nhis direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is . \\nand there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings \" don\\'t cry for me , argentina , \" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is . \\nmadonna\\'s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film . \\nat the beginning , she looks like she\\'s too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) . \\nher death , though , is brilliant . \\nher singing could be better though . \\ni know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she\\'s trying to hard . \\nshe sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti \\nlupone - i heard her sing on an old \" evita \" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) . \\nbut it\\'s generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires . \\nantonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i\\'m one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator . \\nhis singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin . \\nhe does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range . \\nand jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade . \\nalthough it gets off to a rocky start ( \" rocky \" \\'s polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical . \\nlike the other musical released in \\'96 ( woody allen\\'s \" everyone says i love you \" ) , it\\'s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance . \\n',\n",

\\nthat would be the rest of it . \\nthe flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets . \\nthe two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road . \\nit\\'s not funny ; it\\'s pathetic and brainless . \\nthe film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way . \\ni watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie . \\nthe main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set . \\nalso , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in . \\ni like wrestling . \\ni watch it at home and laugh . \\nit\\'s continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn\\'t watch it . \\nthis movie wasn\\'t even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv . \\nthe only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew . \\nthe funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently . \\nthe movie was too dim-witted to be funny . \\nit is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever . \\na recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city . \\nthat movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film . \\nthe acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh . \\nnow that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads . \\nat least he has a hot wife in courtney cox . \\nhe\\'s in the funny parts of the film but there aren\\'t enough to make him look good . \\nthe music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock\\'s \" bawitdaba \" and \" cowboy \" . \\nmartin landau has a great cameo as a classic , hard-nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne . \\nscript is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin . \\na fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it . \\nat times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real . \\nthe wrestlers form alliances , go to people\\'s houses and beat them up . \\nit\\'s utterly ridiculous . \\nthe whole film was a wasteful , dumfounding experience . \\nthe movie was made to pay homage to the fans , telling them things that made wrestling , not the wrestlers . \\nthe wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty-humor movie . \\nthe wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two-hour commercial to watch it . \\nif you\\'re going to watch wrestling watch wwf , it\\'s actually entertaining . \\nthe wrestling is betters , they\\'re funnier , more diverse , and have better entrance themes . \\noh and the girls are hotter . \\nis this what movies have become , 2 hour-long commercials that you have to pay to see ?

ve humanist tale of improbable hope . \\na hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community . \\nhe returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman , turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art , and turning the band into a popular draw . \\ninnocence triumphs . \\nbubby becomes a holy fool , an idiot savant , and graces us with wisdom . \\nit\\'s a strange turn of events , but by now we shouldn\\'t be surprised , because bad boy bubby ain\\'t like other movies . \\n',\n",

       " b'the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole . . . \\nand , in the future , it\\'s also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole . \\nnaturally , this is the setup for the other event horizon . . . \\nthe movie . \\nwhen the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at , just outside of neptune , the crew of the ship called the \" lewis and clark \" has to go to investigate , and dr . william weir , the creator of the \" event horizon , \" gets to come along for the ride . \\nif you\\'ve glanced at a poster for this movie , you know that , supposedly , what follows is \" infinite terror . \" \\nwell , i don\\'t know about the \" terror \" part , but \" infinite \" certainly seems to qualify . . . \\nevent horizon is a mean-spirited , gory , sick excuse for a film . \\nit starts off as an alien rip-off , and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes . \\nat least for those first 40 minutes it\\'s an * interesting * rip-off of alien . \\nthat\\'s a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie , which seems to go on forever . \\nit not a scary monster movie , nor is it a psychological thriller . \\nit is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore . \\nyou\\'ve seen this kind of movie before . \\nthe hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility . \\nthis is a kind of movie for which i have no respect , a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago . \\nit is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore , but event horizon takes the low road , and the viewers pay the price . \\nthere are many good , respectable performances , from fishburne and neill most noticably . \\npaul anderson\\'s direction is impressive , as it was in mortal kombat . \\nthere are many nice special effects , mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero-gravity . \\nthe sets are beautiful to gaze upon . \\nand richard t . jones\\' character ( cooper ) is hilarious and extremely likable ( more so than most characters i\\'ve seen in recent movies ) for the little screen time that he has . \\nand none of this can save the movie from being a d-grade level of film . \\nthe idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls , a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers , is a promising one . \\na haunted house story in space isn\\'t such a bad idea . \\nbut the final execution is extremely disappointing . \\nthat\\'s not to say that philip eisner ( here making his feature film-writing debut ) doesn\\'t have talent . \\nfor those first 40 minutes , he manages to make a tired premise interesting , adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip-off story , and that\\'s something that not too many writers can do . \\nhe even has one scene that , though it also tries to sicken the audience , has a honestly tense feel to it ( the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space ) . \\nhe definitely has something of a gift , but it\\'s not fully on display here . \\ni certainly will look forward to seeing more from him , and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise . \\nbut because of what this movie degenerates into , i have little or no respect , and got little or no enjoyment , out of it . \\nif this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film , then i agree with laurence fishburne\\'s sentiment - \" god help us . \" \\n',\n",
